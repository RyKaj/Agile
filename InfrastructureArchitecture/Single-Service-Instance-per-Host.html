            <div id="content" class="view">
                <h2>Context</h2>
                You have applied the 
                <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Microservice architecture pattern</a> and architected your system as a set of services. Each service is deployed as a set of service instances for throughput and availability.
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                How are services packaged and deployed?
                <h2>Forces</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Services are written using a variety of languages, frameworks, and framework versions</li>
                    <li>Each service consists of multiple service instances for throughput and availability</li>
                    <li>Service must be independently deployable and scalable</li>
                    <li>Service instances need to be isolated from one another</li>
                    <li>You need to be able to quickly build and deploy a service</li>
                    <li>You need to be able to constrain the resources (CPU and memory) consumed by a service</li>
                    <li>You need to monitor the behavior of each service instance</li>
                    <li>You want deployment to reliable</li>
                    <li>You must deploy the application as cost-effectively as possible</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                Deploy each single service instance on its own host
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <h2>Resulting Context</h2>
                <p>The benefits of this approach include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Services instances are isolated from one another</li>
                    <li>There is no possibility of conflicting resource requirements or dependency versions</li>
                    <li>A service instance can only consume at most the resources of a single host</li>
                    <li>Its straightforward to monitor, manage, and redeploy each service instance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The drawbacks of this approach include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Potentially less efficient resource utilization compared to
