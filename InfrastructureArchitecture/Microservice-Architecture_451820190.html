These trends work to help developers collaborate and deploy code:</p><ol><li class="ka kb gf bs kc b kd lg kf lh kh li kj lj kl lk kn lw lm ln" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong class="kc lo">Domain-driven design</strong>: This is the importance of representing the real world in code, harmonizing business logic with development. Splitting up an application into microservices will help each team follow patterns relevant to their domain.</li><li class="ka kb gf bs kc b kd lp kf lq kh lr kj ls kl lt kn lw lm ln" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong class="kc lo">Continuous delivery</strong>: This is about improving the efficiency of getting code changes to production. As microservices are loosely-coupled, developers can deploy them independently.</li><li class="ka kb gf bs kc b kd lp kf lq kh lr kj ls kl lt kn lw lm ln" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong class="kc lo">Virtualization</strong>: This is about provisioning servers for each service at will. Splitting up an application into parts allows one to provide more computing power to services with more traffic. This would save costs over upgrading servers for an entire monolithic application.</li><li class="ka kb gf bs kc b kd lp kf lq kh lr kj ls kl lt kn lw lm ln" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong class="kc lo">Hexagonal architecture</strong>: This is keeping the input/output at the edge of the design of a service. Such a design allows developers to switch out different handlers without changing core code. Microservices are easy to replace due to their simplicity and size.</li><li class="ka kb gf bs kc b kd lp kf lq kh lr kj ls kl lt kn lw lm ln" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong class="kc lo">Development through small teams</strong>: This is the idea that small and independent teams should be responsible for the entire life-cycles of their applications.

Services allow for different technologies, leading to greater optimizations. Developers can also use past knowledge of technologies that are not currently used by the app.</li><li class="ka kb gf bs kc b kd lp kf lq kh lr kj ls kl lt kn lw lm ln" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong class="kc lo">Resilience</strong>: It is easier to isolate a problem in a service when it fails. As the services don’t share many resources, it is likely that the rest of the system can continue to function.</li><li class="ka kb gf bs kc b kd lp kf lq kh lr kj ls kl lt kn lw lm ln" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong class="kc lo">Composability</strong>: Developers can reuse and reconfigure microservices in different ways. They may expand or take out features without affecting other services too much.</li></ol><h2 id="MicroserviceArchitecture-ApplicationScaling:">Application Scaling: </h2><p>Firstly, Microservices are often Stateless and if they are carefully deployed using <strong class="if iv">Docker</strong>, <strong class="if iv">Kubernetes</strong> or using other Infrastructures, Microservices can offer horizontal Scaling within seconds.</p><h2 id="MicroserviceArchitecture-DevelopmentSpeed">Development Speed</h2><p>Microservices are often quite small in size (several hundred to several thousand). Due to the size, adding new features in Microservices are usually faster.</p><h2 id="MicroserviceArchitecture-DevelopmentScaling">Development Scaling</h2><p>Microservices are autonomous and can be developed independently. As a result, Developer Scalability is much better as different developers/teams can work on different microservices autonomously without bumping into each other’s code. So, companies can easily hire more developers and can scale development. Similarly, due to their sizes, Microservices puts small Cognitive load on newly hired Developers or fresh graduates and new Developers can normally write productive codes in a matter of days instead of weeks or months.</p><h2 id="MicroserviceArchitecture-ReleaseCycle">Release Cycle</h2><p>In my opinion, the coolest features of Microservice Architecture is that every Microservice is independently deployable. As a result, the Software Release Cycle in Microservice Applications is much smaller and with <strong class="if iv">CI/CD</strong>, it is possible to give several releases per day.</p><h2 id="MicroserviceArchitecture-Modularization">Modularization</h2><p>In Microservice Architecture, the boundary between the Microservices are external Interfaces aka Physical (Network) which is hard to cross. As a result, correctly designed Microservices often offers the “Loosely coupled, highly cohesive” Modularization. If we compare Software Development with society, then Microservice Modulation is like strict national, international laws with police/punishments. As we know already, usually strict national, international laws can ensure law and order in society.</p><h2 id="MicroserviceArchitecture-Modernization">Modernization</h2><p>As Microservices are loosely coupled and only communicate via language-agnostic way with each other, a single Microservice can easily be replaced by a new one which can be developed using a new programming language and Tech Stack without affecting the whole system. Modernization in Microservice Architecture is incremental and not Big Bang.</p></div></div><div id="expander-985993206" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-985993206" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Disadvantages of using microservices</div><div id="expander-content-985993206" class="expand-content"><p class="id ie ef at if b ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq">As like anything in life, Microservice Architecture has also its price and a fair share of disadvantages. It is by no means a <strong class="if iv">Golden Hammer</strong> which can solve all sort of Problems in a Software Application or in the Organization. It is no surprise that fellow Microservice expert <a href="https://twitter.com/origsmartassam?lang=en" class="external-link" style="text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv"><em class="jb">Sam Newman</em></strong></a> has started his highly acclaimed book “<a class="external-link" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://samnewman.io/books/building_microservices/" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv">Building Microservices</strong></a>” with a scenario where moving to Microservice Architecture from Monolithic Architecture without proper architecture/consideration which leads to the nightmarish condition. There are also some Blog posts like “<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv">Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar</strong></a>” or “<a href="https://dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv">The Death of Microservice Madness in 2018</strong></a>” where the writers discussed the great number of ordeals and pains they suffered to move from Monolith to Microservice Architecture. Here are some disadvantages of Microservice Architecture:</p><ul><li class="id ie ef at if b ig iw ii ix ik iy im iz io ja iq jj jk jl" style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong class="if iv">Design Complexity</strong>: Monolithic Architecture often gives “One size fits for all” solution for Business applications. For example, if a Web application is a few thousand lines of Code or several millions of lines of Code, Monolithic Architecture gives the same solution (Enterprise Java or Ruby on Rails or PHP). But in Microservice Architecture, there are many solutions possible depending on the applications and use cases. So, if the wrong solution is taken for wrong application size/type (e.g. put a kid's clothes on a full-grown man or vice versa), then Microservice Architecture is bound to fail. Also, designing Microservices is challenging as there are far more moving parts compared to Monoliths. Usually, a badly designed Microservice is worse than a Monolith.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong class="if iv">Distributed Systems Complexity: </strong>Microservices are often distributed system and we know that Distributed Systems are complex and has a unique set of challenges compared to single Machine systems. A detailed discussion of Distributed systems is out of the scope of this article but interested readers can read “<a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing" style="text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv">The Fallacies of Distributed Systems</strong></a>”. In short, the following problems can arise in Distributed Microservices: <strong class="if iv"><em class="jb">Overall System latency is higher, Network failure or Individual Node failure can bring the whole system down, Operational complexities are higher</em></strong>.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong class="if iv">Operational Complexity</strong>: Once the complex Monolithic application is decomposed into many Microservices, the complexity often moves from source code to operations. Simple operations like Logging, Monitoring became more complex because instead of one Systems, many more Systems need to be handled. Often, the existing Logging/Monitoring tool does not fit with Microservices and new Logging, Monitoring tools are needed. Tracing is also very important in Microservices to measure the performance/latency of individual Microservices for a Service Request. The complete System test is likewise quite complex in Microservices compared to Monolithic Applications. Likewise, new Infrastructures are needed for Service Discovery, Resiliency. As renowned Computer Scientist and Microservice Guru <a class="external-link" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://martinfowler.com/" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv"><em class="jb">Martin Fowler</em></strong></a> have pointed out, the initial Development Velocity of Microservice Architecture is lower compared to Monolithic Architecture due to the Operational Complexities.</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img height="250" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/937/1*MrDMARKuvUCZliIvT5XtGg.png" data-image-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/937/1*MrDMARKuvUCZliIvT5XtGg.png"></p><ul><li class="id ie ef at if b ig iw ii ix ik iy im iz io ja iq jj jk jl" style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong class="if iv">Security:</strong> Security in Software Systems is often the Elephant in the Room what everybody can see but nobody wants to talk about. Securing one Software Application is hard, securing hundreds of Microservices which are often Distributed Systems is quite a challenge.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong class="if iv">Data Sharing and Data Consistency: </strong>Ideally, every Microservice should have its own Data Store. The downside is that the Microservices need to share data between themselves to fulfill the Business goal. Data consistency is another challenge because the classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_locking" class="external-link" style="text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv">Two Phase Locking</strong></a> to support consistency in the distributed databases is not recommended for two reasons: It does not Scale and many Modern Data Store does not support it. Most of the modern <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv">NoSQL Databases</strong></a> only offers <a class="external-link" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv">Eventual Consistency</strong></a> which needs careful design.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong class="if iv">Communication Complexities:</strong> As already discussed, Microservices achieves strict modularity and development autonomy via process/network boundaries. The downside is that the services can only communicate via the physical network which eventually leads to higher network latency. There are many ways Microservices can communicate with each other: <strong class="if iv">Synchronous Communication</strong> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" class="external-link" style="text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv">REST</strong></a>, <a class="external-link" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv">gRPC </strong></a>or <strong class="if iv">Asynchronous Communication</strong> using <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue" style="text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv">Message Queue</strong></a>, <a class="external-link" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_broker" rel="nofollow"><strong class="if iv">Message Broker</strong></a> where each of them has Pros and Cons. Synchronous communication is easier to implement but can lead to the so-called D<strong class="if iv">istributed Monolith</strong>. Asynchronous Communication via Messaging gives more flexibility with the price of higher implementational complexity. Choosing the right Communication mechanism depending on the application is also challenging in Microservice Architecture.</li></ul></div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><b>Considerations</b></div><div class="panelContent">

When developing the first version of an application, you often do not have the problems that this approach solves. Moreover, using an elaborate, distributed architecture will slow down development. This can be a major problem for startups whose biggest challenge is often how to rapidly evolve the business model and accompanying application.

<p>Keep each microservice’s persistent data private to that service and accessible only via its API.

It cannot be accessed directly by other services.</p><p>There are a few different ways to keep a service’s persistent data private. You do not need to provision a database server for each service. For example, if you are using a relational database then the options are:</p><ul><li>Private-tables-per-service – each service owns a set of tables that must only be accessed by that service</li><li>Schema-per-service – each service has a database schema that’s private to that service</li><li>Database-server-per-service – each service has it’s own database server.</li></ul><p>Private-tables-per-service and schema-per-service have the lowest overhead. Using a schema per service is appealing since it makes ownership clearer. Some high throughput services might need their own database server.</p><p>It is a good idea to create barriers that enforce this modularity. You could, for example, assign a different database user id to each service and use a database access control mechanism such as grants. Without some kind of barrier to enforce encapsulation, developers will always be tempted to bypass a service’s API and access it’s data directly.</p>

Use a (single) database that is shared by multiple services. Each service freely accesses data owned by other services using local ACID transactions.

<p>Implement each business transaction that spans multiple services as a saga. A saga is a sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates the database and publishes a message or event to trigger the next local transaction in the saga.

</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>To perform a single task, a client may have to make multiple calls to various backend services. An application that relies on many services to perform a task must expend resources on each request. When any new feature or service is added to the application, additional requests are needed, further increasing resource requirements and network calls. This chattiness between a client and a backend can adversely impact the performance and scale of the application. Microservice architectures have made this problem more common, as applications built around many smaller services naturally have a higher amount of cross-service calls.</p><p>In the following diagram, the client sends requests to each service (1,2,3). Each service processes the request and sends the response back to the application (4,5,6). Over a cellular network with typically high latency, using individual requests in this manner is inefficient and could result in broken connectivity or incomplete requests. While each request may be done in parallel, the application must send, wait, and process data for each request, all on separate connections, increasing the chance of failure.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533350/463533348.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533350/463533348.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533348" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="gateway-aggregation-problem (1).png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533350" data-linked-resource-container-version="3"></p><p><br/></p>

The application makes a single request and receives only a single response from the gateway.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533350/463533349.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533350/463533349.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533349" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="gateway-aggregation (1).png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533350" data-linked-resource-container-version="3"><img alt="New-API-GW-Diagram" height="150" src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/serverless/New-API-GW-Diagram.c9fc9835d2a9aa00ef90d0ddc4c6402a2536de0d.png" data-image-src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/serverless/New-API-GW-Diagram.c9fc9835d2a9aa00ef90d0ddc4c6402a2536de0d.png"><img class="confluence-embedded-image img-responsive confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="https://microservices.io/i/apigateway.jpg" data-image-src="https://microservices.io/i/apigateway.jpg"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533350/463533529.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533350/463533529.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533529" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Screen-Shot-2020-02-25-at-11.19.16-AM-768x631.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533350" data-linked-resource-container-version="3"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533350/463533530.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533350/463533530.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533530" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Screen-Shot-2020-02-25-at-11.20.01-AM-1536x545.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533350" data-linked-resource-container-version="3"><img class="confluence-embedded-image img-responsive confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="https://microservices.io/i/bffe.png" data-image-src="https://microservices.io/i/bffe.png"></p><p><br/></p><h2 id="MicroserviceArchitecture-UsinganAPIgatewayhasthefollowingbenefits">Using an API gateway has the following benefits</h2><ul><li>Insulates the clients from how the application is partitioned into microservices</li><li>Insulates the clients from the problem of determining the locations of service instances</li><li>Provides the optimal API for each client</li><li>Reduces the number of requests/roundtrips.

Ensure the gateway has adequate performance to handle load and can be scaled to meet your anticipated growth.</li><li>Perform load testing against the gateway to ensure you don't introduce cascading failures for services.</li><li>Implement a resilient design, using techniques such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/bulkhead" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">bulkheads</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">circuit breaking</a>, <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/retry" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">retry</a>, and timeouts.</li><li>If one or more service calls takes too long, it may be acceptable to timeout and return a partial set of data. Consider how your application will handle this scenario.</li><li>Use asynchronous I/O to ensure that a delay at the backend doesn't cause performance issues in the application.</li><li>Implement distributed tracing using correlation IDs to track each individual call.</li><li>Monitor request metrics and response sizes.</li><li>Consider returning cached data as a failover strategy to handle failures.</li><li>Instead of building aggregation into the gateway, consider placing an aggregation service behind the gateway. Request aggregation will likely have different resource requirements than other services in the gateway and may impact the gateway's routing and offloading functionality.</li><li>How implement the API gateway? An event-driven/reactive approach is best if it must scale to scale to handle high loads. On the JVM, NIO-based libraries such as Netty, Spring Reactor, etc. make sense.

<p>When you start the development of an application you often spend a significant amount of time putting in place the mechanisms to handle cross-cutting concerns. Examples of cross-cutting concern include:</p><ul><li>Externalized configuration - includes credentials, and network locations of external services such as databases and message brokers</li><li>Logging - configuring of a logging framework such as log4j or logback</li><li>Health checks - a url that a monitoring service can “ping” to determine the health of the application</li><li>Metrics - measurements that provide insight into what the application is doing and how it is performing</li><li><a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/distributed-tracing.html" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Distributed tracing</a> - instrument services with code that assigns each external request an unique identifier that is passed between services.</li></ul><p>As well as these generic cross-cutting concerns, there are also cross-cutting concerns that are specific to the technologies that an application uses. Applications that use infrastructure services such as databases or a message brokers require boilerplate configuration in order to do that. For example, applications that use a relational database must be configured with a connection pool. Web applications that process HTTP requests also need boilerplate configuration.</p><p>It is common to spend one or two days, sometimes even longer, setting up these mechanisms. If you going to spend months or years developing a monolithic application then the upfront investment in handling cross-cutting concerns is insignificant. The situation is very different, however, if you are developing an application that has the <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">microservice architecture</a>. There are tens or hundreds of services. You will frequently create new services, each of which will only take days or weeks to develop. You cannot afford to spend a few days configuring the mechanisms to handle cross-cutting concerns. What is even worse is that in a microservice architecture there are additional cross-cutting concerns that you have to deal with including service registration and discovery, and circuit breakers for reliably handling partial failure.</p>

<p>Handle faults that might take a variable amount of time to recover from, when connecting to a remote service or resource. This can improve the stability and resiliency of an application.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>In a distributed environment, calls to remote resources and services can fail due to transient faults, such as slow network connections, timeouts, or the resources being overcommitted or temporarily unavailable. These faults typically correct themselves after a short period of time, and a robust cloud application should be prepared to handle them by using a strategy such as the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/retry" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Retry pattern</a>.</p><p>However, there can also be situations where faults are due to unanticipated events, and that might take much longer to fix. These faults can range in severity from a partial loss of connectivity to the complete failure of a service. In these situations it might be pointless for an application to continually retry an operation that is unlikely to succeed, and instead the application should quickly accept that the operation has failed and handle this failure accordingly.</p><p>Additionally, if a service is very busy, failure in one part of the system might lead to cascading failures. For example, an operation that invokes a service could be configured to implement a timeout, and reply with a failure message if the service fails to respond within this period. However, this strategy could cause many concurrent requests to the same operation to be blocked until the timeout period expires. These blocked requests might hold critical system resources such as memory, threads, database connections, and so on. Consequently, these resources could become exhausted, causing failure of other possibly unrelated parts of the system that need to use the same resources. In these situations, it would be preferable for the operation to fail immediately, and only attempt to invoke the service if it's likely to succeed. Note that setting a shorter timeout might help to resolve this problem, but the timeout shouldn't be so short that the operation fails most of the time, even if the request to the service would eventually succeed.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>The Circuit Breaker pattern, popularized by Michael Nygard in his book, <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Release It!</a>, can prevent an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that's likely to fail. Allowing it to continue without waiting for the fault to be fixed or wasting CPU cycles while it determines that the fault is long lasting. The Circuit Breaker pattern also enables an application to detect whether the fault has been resolved. If the problem appears to have been fixed, the application can try to invoke the operation.</p><blockquote><p>The purpose of the Circuit Breaker pattern is different than the Retry pattern. The Retry pattern enables an application to retry an operation in the expectation that it'll succeed. The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents an application from performing an operation that is likely to fail. An application can combine these two patterns by using the Retry pattern to invoke an operation through a circuit breaker. However, the retry logic should be sensitive to any exceptions returned by the circuit breaker and abandon retry attempts if the circuit breaker indicates that a fault is not transient.</p></blockquote><p>A circuit breaker acts as a proxy for operations that might fail. The proxy should monitor the number of recent failures that have occurred, and use this information to decide whether to allow the operation to proceed, or simply return an exception immediately.</p><p>The proxy can be implemented as a state machine with the following states that mimic the functionality of an electrical circuit breaker:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Closed</strong>: The request from the application is routed to the operation. The proxy maintains a count of the number of recent failures, and if the call to the operation is unsuccessful the proxy increments this count. If the number of recent failures exceeds a specified threshold within a given time period, the proxy is placed into the <strong>Open</strong> state. At this point the proxy starts a timeout timer, and when this timer expires the proxy is placed into the <strong>Half-Open</strong> state.</p><blockquote><p>The purpose of the timeout timer is to give the system time to fix the problem that caused the failure before allowing the application to try to perform the operation again.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Open</strong>: The request from the application fails immediately and an exception is returned to the application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Half-Open</strong>: A limited number of requests from the application are allowed to pass through and invoke the operation. If these requests are successful, it's assumed that the fault that was previously causing the failure has been fixed and the circuit breaker switches to the <strong>Closed</strong> state (the failure counter is reset). If any request fails, the circuit breaker assumes that the fault is still present so it reverts back to the <strong>Open</strong> state and restarts the timeout timer to give the system a further period of time to recover from the failure.</p><blockquote><p>The<strong>Half-Open</strong>state is useful to prevent a recovering service from suddenly being flooded with requests. As a service recovers, it might be able to support a limited volume of requests until the recovery is complete, but while recovery is in progress a flood of work can cause the service to time out or fail again.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533311/463533310.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533311/463533310.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533310" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="circuit-breaker-diagram.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533311" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>In the figure, the failure counter used by the <strong>Closed</strong> state is time based. It's automatically reset at periodic intervals. This helps to prevent the circuit breaker from entering the <strong>Open</strong> state if it experiences occasional failures. The failure threshold that trips the circuit breaker into the <strong>Open</strong> state is only reached when a specified number of failures have occurred during a specified interval. The counter used by the <strong>Half-Open</strong> state records the number of successful attempts to invoke the operation. The circuit breaker reverts to the <strong>Closed</strong> state after a specified number of consecutive operation invocations have been successful. If any invocation fails, the circuit breaker enters the <strong>Open</strong> state immediately and the success counter will be reset the next time it enters the <strong>Half-Open</strong> state.</p><blockquote><p>How the system recovers is handled externally, possibly by restoring or restarting a failed component or repairing a network connection.</p></blockquote><p>The Circuit Breaker pattern provides stability while the system recovers from a failure and minimizes the impact on performance. It can help to maintain the response time of the system by quickly rejecting a request for an operation that's likely to fail, rather than waiting for the operation to time out, or never return. If the circuit breaker raises an event each time it changes state, this information can be used to monitor the health of the part of the system protected by the circuit breaker, or to alert an administrator when a circuit breaker trips to the <strong>Open</strong> state.</p><p>The pattern is customizable and can be adapted according to the type of the possible failure. For example, you can apply an increasing timeout timer to a circuit breaker. You could place the circuit breaker in the <strong>Open</strong> state for a few seconds initially, and then if the failure hasn't been resolved increase the timeout to a few minutes, and so on. In some cases, rather than the <strong>Open</strong> state returning failure and raising an exception, it could be useful to return a default value that is meaningful to the application.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>You should consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><p><strong>Exception Handling</strong>. An application invoking an operation through a circuit breaker must be prepared to handle the exceptions raised if the operation is unavailable. The way exceptions are handled will be application specific. For example, an application could temporarily degrade its functionality, invoke an alternative operation to try to perform the same task or obtain the same data, or report the exception to the user and ask them to try again later.</p><p><strong>Types of Exceptions</strong>. A request might fail for many reasons, some of which might indicate a more severe type of failure than others. For example, a request might fail because a remote service has crashed and will take several minutes to recover, or because of a timeout due to the service being temporarily overloaded. A circuit breaker might be able to examine the types of exceptions that occur and adjust its strategy depending on the nature of these exceptions. For example, it might require a larger number of timeout exceptions to trip the circuit breaker to the <strong>Open</strong> state compared to the number of failures due to the service being completely unavailable.</p><p><strong>Logging</strong>. A circuit breaker should log all failed requests (and possibly successful requests) to enable an administrator to monitor the health of the operation.</p><p><strong>Recoverability</strong>. You should configure the circuit breaker to match the likely recovery pattern of the operation it's protecting. For example, if the circuit breaker remains in the <strong>Open</strong> state for a long period, it could raise exceptions even if the reason for the failure has been resolved. Similarly, a circuit breaker could fluctuate and reduce the response times of applications if it switches from the <strong>Open</strong> state to the <strong>Half-Open</strong> state too quickly.</p><p><strong>Testing Failed Operations</strong>. In the <strong>Open</strong> state, rather than using a timer to determine when to switch to the <strong>Half-Open</strong> state, a circuit breaker can instead periodically ping the remote service or resource to determine whether it's become available again. This ping could take the form of an attempt to invoke an operation that had previously failed, or it could use a special operation provided by the remote service specifically for testing the health of the service, as described by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/health-endpoint-monitoring" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Health Endpoint Monitoring pattern</a>.</p><p><strong>Manual Override</strong>. In a system where the recovery time for a failing operation is extremely variable, it's beneficial to provide a manual reset option that enables an administrator to close a circuit breaker (and reset the failure counter). Similarly, an administrator could force a circuit breaker into the <strong>Open</strong> state (and restart the timeout timer) if the operation protected by the circuit breaker is temporarily unavailable.</p><p><strong>Concurrency</strong>. The same circuit breaker could be accessed by a large number of concurrent instances of an application. The implementation shouldn't block concurrent requests or add excessive overhead to each call to an operation.</p><p><strong>Resource Differentiation</strong>. Be careful when using a single circuit breaker for one type of resource if there might be multiple underlying independent providers. For example, in a data store that contains multiple shards, one shard might be fully accessible while another is experiencing a temporary issue. If the error responses in these scenarios are merged, an application might try to access some shards even when failure is highly likely, while access to other shards might be blocked even though it's likely to succeed.</p><p><strong>Accelerated Circuit Breaking</strong>. Sometimes a failure response can contain enough information for the circuit breaker to trip immediately and stay tripped for a minimum amount of time. For example, the error response from a shared resource that's overloaded could indicate that an immediate retry isn't recommended and that the application should instead try again in a few minutes.</p><blockquote><p>A service can return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) if it is throttling the client, or HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) if the service is not currently available. The response can include additional information, such as the anticipated duration of the delay.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Replaying Failed Requests</strong>. In the <strong>Open</strong> state, rather than simply failing quickly, a circuit breaker could also record the details of each request to a journal and arrange for these requests to be replayed when the remote resource or service becomes available.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Timeouts on External Services</strong>. A circuit breaker might not be able to fully protect applications from operations that fail in external services that are configured with a lengthy timeout period. If the timeout is too long, a thread running a circuit breaker might be blocked for an extended period before the circuit breaker indicates that the operation has failed. In this time, many other application instances might also try to invoke the service through the circuit breaker and tie up a significant number of threads before they all fail.</p>

</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>It's a good practice, and often a business requirement, to monitor web applications and back-end services, to ensure they're available and performing correctly. However, it's more difficult to monitor services running in the cloud than it is to monitor on-premises services. For example, you don't have full control of the hosting environment, and the services typically depend on other services provided by platform vendors and others.</p><p>There are many factors that affect cloud-hosted applications such as network latency, the performance and availability of the underlying compute and storage systems, and the network bandwidth between them. The service can fail entirely or partially due to any of these factors. Therefore, you must verify at regular intervals that the service is performing correctly to ensure the required level of availability, which might be part of your service level agreement (SLA).</p>

<p>Implement health monitoring by sending requests to an endpoint on the application. The application should perform the necessary checks, and return an indication of its status.</p><p>A health monitoring check typically combines two factors:</p><ul><li>The checks (if any) performed by the application or service in response to the request to the health verification endpoint.</li><li>Analysis of the results by the tool or framework that performs the health verification check.</li></ul><p>The response code indicates the status of the application and, optionally, any components or services it uses. The latency or response time check is performed by the monitoring tool or framework.

It's relatively easy to create a service endpoint whose sole purpose is to perform some functional tests on the system.</p><p>Typical checks that can be performed by the monitoring tools include:</p><ul><li>Validating the response code. For example, an HTTP response of 200 (OK) indicates that the application responded without error. The monitoring system might also check for other response codes to give more comprehensive results.</li><li>Checking the content of the response to detect errors, even when a 200 (OK) status code is returned. This can detect errors that affect only a section of the returned web page or service response. For example, checking the title of a page or looking for a specific phrase that indicates the correct page was returned.</li><li>Measuring the response time, which indicates a combination of the network latency and the time that the application took to execute the request. An increasing value can indicate an emerging problem with the application or network.</li><li>Checking resources or services located outside the application, such as a content delivery network used by the application to deliver content from global caches.</li><li>Checking for expiration of SSL certificates.</li><li>Measuring the response time of a DNS lookup for the URL of the application to measure DNS latency and DNS failures.</li><li>Validating the URL returned by the DNS lookup to ensure correct entries. This can help to avoid malicious request redirection through a successful attack on the DNS server.</li></ul><p>It's also useful, where possible, to run these checks from different on-premises or hosted locations to measure and compare response times. Ideally you should monitor applications from locations that are close to customers to get an accurate view of the performance from each location. In addition to providing a more robust checking mechanism, the results can help you decide on the deployment location for the application—and whether to deploy it in more than one datacenter.</p><p>Tests should also be run against all the service instances that customers use to ensure the application is working correctly for all customers. For example, if customer storage is spread across more than one storage account, the monitoring process should check all of these.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><p>How to validate the response. For example, is just a single 200 (OK) status code sufficient to verify the application is working correctly? While this provides the most basic measure of application availability, and is the minimum implementation of this pattern, it provides little information about the operations, trends, and possible upcoming issues in the application.</p><blockquote><p>Make sure that the application correctly returns a 200 (OK) only when the target resource is found and processed. In some scenarios, such as when using a master page to host the target web page, the server sends back a 200 (OK) status code instead of a 404 (Not Found) code, even when the target content page was not found.</p></blockquote><p>The number of endpoints to expose for an application. One approach is to expose at least one endpoint for the core services that the application uses and another for lower priority services, allowing different levels of importance to be assigned to each monitoring result. Also consider exposing more endpoints, such as one for each core service, for additional monitoring granularity. For example, a health verification check might check the database, storage, and an external geocoding service that an application uses, with each requiring a different level of uptime and response time. The application could still be healthy if the geocoding service, or some other background task, is unavailable for a few minutes.</p><p>Whether to use the same endpoint for monitoring as is used for general access, but to a specific path designed for health verification checks, for example, /HealthCheck/{GUID}/ on the general access endpoint. This allows some functional tests in the application to be run by the monitoring tools, such as adding a new user registration, signing in, and placing a test order, while also verifying that the general access endpoint is available.</p><p>The type of information to collect in the service in response to monitoring requests, and how to return this information. Most existing tools and frameworks look only at the HTTP status code that the endpoint returns. To return and validate additional information, you might have to create a custom monitoring utility or service.</p><p>How much information to collect. Performing excessive processing during the check can overload the application and impact other users. The time it takes might exceed the timeout of the monitoring system so it marks the application as unavailable. Most applications include instrumentation such as error handlers and performance counters that log performance and detailed error information, this might be sufficient instead of returning additional information from a health verification check.</p><p>Caching the endpoint status. It could be expensive to run the health check too frequently. If the health status is reported through a dashboard, for example, you don't want every request from the dashboard to trigger a health check. Instead, periodically check the system health and cache the status. Expose an endpoint that returns the cached status.</p><p>How to configure security for the monitoring endpoints to protect them from public access, which might expose the application to malicious attacks, risk the exposure of sensitive information, or attract denial of service (DoS) attacks. Typically this should be done in the application configuration so that it can be updated easily without restarting the application. Consider using one or more of the following techniques:</p><ul><li><p>Secure the endpoint by requiring authentication. You can do this by using an authentication security key in the request header or by passing credentials with the request, provided that the monitoring service or tool supports authentication.</p><ul><li><p>Use an obscure or hidden endpoint. For example, expose the endpoint on a different IP address to that used by the default application URL, configure the endpoint on a nonstandard HTTP port, and/or use a complex path to the test page. You can usually specify additional endpoint addresses and ports in the application configuration, and add entries for these endpoints to the DNS server if required to avoid having to specify the IP address directly.</p></li><li><p>Expose a method on an endpoint that accepts a parameter such as a key value or an operation mode value. Depending on the value supplied for this parameter, when a request is received the code can perform a specific test or set of tests, or return a 404 (Not Found) error if the parameter value isn't recognized. The recognized parameter values could be set in the application configuration.</p><blockquote><p>DoS attacks are likely to have less impact on a separate endpoint that performs basic functional tests without compromising the operation of the application. Ideally, avoid using a test that might expose sensitive information. If you must return information that might be useful to an attacker, consider how you'll protect the endpoint and the data from unauthorized access. In this case just relying on obscurity isn't enough. You should also consider using an HTTPS connection and encrypting any sensitive data, although this will increase the load on the server.</p></blockquote></li></ul></li><li><p>How to access an endpoint that's secured using authentication. Not all tools and frameworks can be configured to include credentials with the health verification request. For example, Microsoft Azure built-in health verification features can't provide authentication credentials.

One approach is to expose an endpoint that simply returns a value from the application configuration or a random value that can be used to test the agent.</p><blockquote><p>Also ensure that the monitoring system performs checks on itself, such as a self-test and built-in test, to avoid it issuing false positive results.</p></blockquote></li></ul>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>When to use this Pattern</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>This pattern is useful for:</p><ul><li>Monitoring websites and web applications to verify availability.</li><li>Monitoring websites and web applications to check for correct operation.</li><li>Monitoring middle-tier or shared services to detect and isolate a failure that could disrupt other applications.</li><li>Complementing existing instrumentation in the application, such as performance counters and error handlers. Health verification checking doesn't replace the requirement for logging and auditing in the application. Instrumentation can provide valuable information for an existing framework that monitors counters and error logs to detect failures or other issues. However, it can't provide information if the application is unavailable.</li></ul>

On contrary to Monolith Architecture which gives one solution for all, Microservice Architecture gives a different solution for different problems. If the wrong solution is chosen, then the Microservice Architecture is just a ticking time bomb that is destined to explode. A badly designed Microservice Architecture is worse than a Monolith. Defining a set of Best practices for Microservice Architecture is also challenging. I have seen some conference talks where some renowned and respected Software Engineers have proposed Microservice Architecture best practices which are counterproductive.</p><p>Here I am proposing some best practices which will help to develop effective Microservice Applications where the target project is supposed to live more than 6 months and team size is moderate to large (6+ developers).

If Microservices are not split in the right way, there will be tightly coupled Microservices which will have all the disadvantages of a Monolith and all the complexities of Microservices aka <strong>Distributed Monolith</strong>. Fortunately, there is already a Solution which can greatly help in this regard. <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://twitter.com/ericevans0?lang=en" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><strong><em class="ig">Eric Evans</em></strong></a>, a Software Engineering Consultant back then, had encountered recurring issues regarding software complexity in Business Applications across different companies and has summarized his valuable insight in the book “<a href="http://dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/" class="external-link" style="text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow"><strong>Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</strong></a>” in 2004.

Database per Microservice</div><div id="expander-content-124158052" class="expand-content"><p>After splitting the Complex application into Micro-Service Modules, the next challenge arises, what to do with the Database? Shall we share the database among Microservices or not. The answer to the question is the double edge sword. On the one hand, sharing the database among microservices will lead to strong coupling among the Microservices which is exactly the opposite of the goal of Microservices Architecture. Even a small change in a database will need synchronization among teams. Also, managing Transaction and Locking of a Database in one service is challenging enough. But managing Transaction/Locking among multiple distributed Microservices is a daunting task. On the other hand, if every Microservice has own database/private tables, then exchanging data between Microservices opens the pandora’s box of challenges. As a result, many prominent Software Engineers have advocated for a shared database among Microservices as a pragmatic solution. However, in my opinion, Microservice is all about sustainable and long term software development. As a result, every Microservice should have its Database (or Private Tables).</p></div></div><div id="expander-1797241143" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1797241143" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>3. Micro Frontends</div><div id="expander-content-1797241143" class="expand-content"><p>Unfortunately, most of the Backend developers have a backdated view about Frontend Development and think that Frontend Development is simple. As most Software Architects are Backend Developers, they have little regard for Frontend and Frontend is usually neglected in the Architecture Design. Very often in Microservice projects, backends are very finely modularized with their database but there is one Monolith Frontend. In the best case, they consider one of the hottest SPA (React, Angular, Vue) to develop the Monolith Frontend. The main problem of this approach is that Frontend Monolith is as bad as Backend Monolith as I have described <a style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/microservice-architecture-a-brief-overview-and-why-you-should-use-it-in-your-next-project-a17b6e19adfd" rel="nofollow"><strong>previously</strong></a>. Also, when the Frontend needs to be modernized due to changes in Browser, then it requires a Big Bang modernization (<em class="ig">That is the reason why so many companies are still using the outdated Angular 1 framework</em>). The web is simple yet very powerful and inherently offers transclusion. There are many ways to develop SPA based Microfrontends: with iFrame, Web Components or via (Angular/React) Elements.</p></div></div><div id="expander-1944774319" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1944774319" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>4. Continuous Delivery</div><div id="expander-content-1944774319" class="expand-content"><p>One of the key USP of Microservice Architecture is that each Microservice can be deployed independently. If you have a system of e.g. 100 Microservices and only one Microservice needs to be changed, then you can update only one Microservice without touching the other 99. But deploying 100 Microservices independently without Automation (DevOps, CI/CD) is a daunting task. To take full advantage of this Microservice feature, one needs CI/CD and DevOps. Using Microservice Architecture without CI/CD, DevOps, Automation is like buying the latest Porsche and then drive it with hand-brake. It is no wonder that <a style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePrerequisites.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>CI/CD</strong></a> is listed as one of the three prerequisites to use Microservice Architecture by Microservice Expert <strong><em class="ig">Martin Fowler</em></strong>.</p></div></div><div id="expander-1530478627" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1530478627" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>5. Observability</div><div id="expander-content-1530478627" class="expand-content"><p>One of the main drawbacks of Microservice Architecture is that Software Development became simple at the expense of Operations. With one Monolith, it is much simpler to monitor the application. But having many microservices run on containers, observability of the whole system became very crucial and complicated. Even Logging became complicated to aggregate logs from many containers/machines into a central place. Fortunately, there are already many Enterprise grade solutions in the market. For example, <strong>ELK/Splunk</strong> offers Logging for Microservices. <strong>Prometheus/App Dynamics</strong> offers industry-grade monitoring. Another very crucial observability tool in the Microservice world is Tracing. Often one API request to a microservice leads to several cascaded calls to other microservices. To analyze the latency of a Microservice system, it is necessary to measure the latency of each individual Microservice. <strong>Zipkin/Jaeger</strong> offers excellent tracing support for Microservices.</p></div></div><div id="expander-956363451" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-956363451" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>6. Unified Tech Stack</div><div id="expander-content-956363451" class="expand-content"><p>Microservice Architecture tells us that for a Microservice, take the programming language and framework best suitable for that microservice. This statement should not be taken literally. Sometime, a microservice may need a new Tech Stack e.g. for CPU heavy/high-performance tasks, programming language like C++/Rust may be chosen. If a Microservice works with Machine learning, maybe Python is a better choice. But using different programming languages/frameworks without any solid reason can lead to too many programming languages and frameworks without any real benefit. Think about the scenario where one microservice is developed using Spring Boot + Kotlin+ React + MySQL, the other one is with JakartaEE + Java + Angular + PostgreSQL, the next one with Scala + Play Framework + VueJS + Oracle then it will need a lots of effort to maintain the different programming language, databases, frameworks without too much gain.</p></div></div><div id="expander-1732171813" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1732171813" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>7. Asynchronous Communications</div><div id="expander-content-1732171813" class="expand-content"><p>One of the most challenging design decisions in Microservice Architecture is how the services will communicate and share data among themselves. This is even more important when each Microservice has its own Data Storage. Typically, one Microservice can exist along but it cannot fulfill all the business goals alone. All the Microservices work together to fulfill the Business goal and to work together, they need to exchange data or trigger other Microservices to do a task. The easiest and most common way to communicate between Microservices is via Synchronous REST API which is pragmatic but a short term solution. If Service A calls Service B, Service B calls Service C, Service C calls service D Synchronously, then latencies added up. Also as Microservices are mostly distributed systems, they could fail. Often Synchronous Microservices lead to failure cascading i.e. Failure in one Service can lead to failure in other services. Synchronous Communication between Microservices also leads to tight coupling between Microservices. For a long term solution, Microservices should communicate Asynchronously. There are many ways for Asynchronous communication between Microservices: via Message Queue e.g. Kafka, via asynchronous REST (ATOM) or CQRS.</p></div></div><div id="expander-2115820046" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-2115820046" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>9. Infrastructure over Libraries</div><div id="expander-content-2115820046" class="expand-content"><p>During the early days of Microservice Software development, Netflix used mainly Java programming to develop Microservices. They also developed many libraries (Netflix OSS Stack including Hystrix, Zuul). Many companies follow through Netflix and started to use the librariesNetflix OSS. Later, many companies (including Netflix) found that Java is not the de facto language to develop Microservices due to its Bulky size and Cold-start problems. Netflix later moved on Polyglot Microservice paradigm and decided not to develop the Netflix OSS further which lead the follower companies into trouble. So, instead of investing heavily in a language-specific library (e.g. Java based Netflix OSS), it is wiser to use frameworks (e.g. Service Meshes, API gateway).<br/></p></div></div><div id="expander-1241811987" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1241811987" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>10. Organizational Considerations</div><div id="expander-content-1241811987" class="expand-content"><p>Almost 50 years ago (1967), <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Conway" style="text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow">Melvin Conway</a> gave an observation that the Software Architecture of a company is limited by Organizational Structure (Conway’s Law). Although the observation is 50 years old, MIT and Harvard Business School have recently found that the law is still valid in modern days. If an organization plans to develop Microservice Architecture, then it should make the team size accordingly (two “American” Pizza team: 7±2 person). Also, the team should be cross-functional and ideally will have Frontend/Backend Developer, Ops Engineering and Tester. Microservice Architecture will only work if the higher Management also changes their viewpoint and vision accordingly.<br/></p></div></div><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><div id="expander-755070292" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-755070292" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>References</div><div id="expander-content-755070292" class="expand-content"><ul><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/microservice-architecture-a-brief-overview-and-why-you-should-use-it-in-your-next-project-a17b6e19adfd" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Towards Data Science - microservice architecture a brief overview and why you should use it in your next project</a></li></ul></div></div><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></p></div></div>

This service and data coupling supports the notion of a bounded context and a share-nothing architecture, where each service and its corresponding data are compartmentalized and completely independent from all other services, exposing only a well-defined interface (the contract). This bounded context is what allows for quick and easy development, testing, and deployment with minimal dependencies.</p><p>The data-driven migration antipattern occurs mostly when you are migrating from a monolithic application to a microservices architecture. The reason this is an antipattern is that it seems like a good idea at the start to migrate both the service functionality and the corresponding data together when creating microservices, but as you will learn in this chapter, this will lead you down a bad path that can result in high risk, excess cost, and additional migration effort. </p><p>There are two primary goals during any microservices conversion effort. The first goal is to split the functionality of the monolithic application into small, single-purpose services. The second goal is to then migrate the monolithic data into small databases (or separate schemas) owned by each service. <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_101" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 1-1</a> shows what a typical migration might look like when both the service code and the corresponding data are migrated at the same time.</p><p><br/></p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image iimagesdata-driven-1png confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="400" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0101-1691c33f307ff43a4a6756e744196034.png" data-image-src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0101-1691c33f307ff43a4a6756e744196034.png"></p><p><span class="label">Figure 1-1. Service and data migration</p><p>Notice there are three services created from the monolithic application along with three separate databases.

Knowing it is always a good idea to start with a more coarse-grained service and split it up further if needed when you learn more about the service, you may be frequently adjusting the granularity of your services. Consider the migration illustrated in <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_101" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 1-1</a>, focusing on the leftmost service. Let's say after learning more about the service you discover it's too coarse-grained and needs to be split up into two smaller services. Alternatively, you may find that the two leftmost services are too fine-grained and need to be consolidated. In either case you are faced with two migration efforts—one for the service functionality and another for the database. This scenario is illustrated in <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_102" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 1-2</a>.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image iimagesdata-driven-2apng confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="400" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0102-d855332b87b6d933ed19a6e1e63f988c.png" data-image-src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0102-d855332b87b6d933ed19a6e1e63f988c.png"></p><p><span class="label">Figure 1-2. Extra data migration after service granularity adjustment</p><p>My good friend and fellow O'Reilly author Alan Beaulieu (<em>Learning SQL</em>) once told me &quot;Data is a corporate asset, not an application asset.&quot; Given Alan's statement, you can gain an appreciation for the risk involved and the concerns raised with continually migrating data. Data migrations are complex and error-prone—much more so than source code migrations. Optimally you want to migrate the data for each service only once. Understanding the risks involved with data migration and the importance of &quot;data over functionality&quot; is the first step in avoiding this antipattern.</p></div></div><div id="expander-1076719722" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1076719722" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Functionality First, Data Last</div><div id="expander-content-1076719722" class="expand-content"><p>The primary avoidance technique for this antipattern is to migrate the functionality of the service first, and worry about the bounded context between the service and the data later. Once you learn more about the service you will likely find the need to adjust the level of granularity through service consolidation or service splitting. After you are satisfied that you have the level of granularity correct, then migrate the data, thereby creating the much-needed bounded context between the service and the data.</p><p>This technique is illustrated in <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_103" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 1-3</a>.

While it is impossible to say how long to wait before migrating the data, it is important to understand the consequences of this avoidance technique—a poor bounded context. The time between when the service is created and the data is finally migrated creates a data coupling between services. This means that when the database schema is changed, all services using that schema must be coordinated from a change control and release standpoint, something you want to avoid with the microservices architecture. However, this tradeoff is well worth the reduced risk involved with avoiding multiple costly database migrations. </p></div></div><div id="expander-1590839294" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1590839294" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>The Timeout AntiPattern</div><div id="expander-content-1590839294" class="expand-content"><p>Microservices is a distributed architecture, meaning all of the components (i.e., services) are deployed as separate applications and are accessed remotely through some sort of remote access protocol. One of the challenges of any distributed architecture is managing remote process availability and responsiveness. Although service availability and service responsiveness are both related to service communication, they are two very different things. Service availability is the ability of the service consumer to connect with the service and be able to send it a request, as shown in <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_201" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 2-1</a>. Service responsiveness, on the other hand, is the time it takes for the service to respond to a given request once you've communicated with it.</p><p><span class="label">Figure 2-1. Service availability vs. responsiveness</p><p>If the service consumer cannot connect with or talk to the service (i.e., availability), the service consumer is usually immediately notified within milliseconds, as <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_201" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 2-1</a> shows. The service consumer may choose to pass this error onto the client or retry the connection several times before giving up and throwing some sort of connection failure. However, assuming the service was reached and a request was made, what happens if the service doesn't respond? In this case the service consumer can choose to wait indefinitely or leverage some sort of timeout value.</p><p>Using a timeout value for service responsiveness seems like a good idea, but can lead you down a bad path known as the timeout anti-pattern.</p></div></div><div id="expander-709195348" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-709195348" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Using Timeout Values</div><div id="expander-content-709195348" class="expand-content"><p>You might be a bit confused at this point. After all, isn't setting a timeout value a good thing? Maybe, but in most cases it can lead you down a bad path. Consider the example where you are making a service request to buy 1000 shares of Apple stock (AAPL). The very last thing you want to do as the service consumer is time out the request right when the service has successfully placed the trade and is about to give you a confirmation number. You can try to resubmit the trade, but you have to add significant complexity into your service to determine if this is a new trade or a duplicate trade. Furthermore, since you don't have a confirmation number from the first trade it is very difficult to know whether the trade was actually successful or not.</p><p>So, given that you don't want to time out the request too early, what should the timeout value be? There are several techniques to address this problem. The first is to calculate the database timeout within the service and use that as a base for determining what the service timeout should be. The second solution, which is by far the most popular technique, is to calculate the maximum time under load and double it, thereby giving you that extra buffer in the event it sometimes takes longer.</p><p><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_202" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 2-2</a> illustrates this technique. Notice that on average the service responds within 2 seconds to place a trade. However, under load the maximum time observed is 5 seconds. Therefore, using the doubling technique, the timeout value for the service consumer would be 10 seconds. Again, the intention with this technique is to avoid timing out the request when in fact it was successful and was in the process of sending you back the confirmation number.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image iimagestimeout-2png confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="250" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0202-24f51f9c4f7e334861b69ca641e5c605.png" data-image-src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0202-24f51f9c4f7e334861b69ca641e5c605.png"></p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><span class="label">Figure 2-2. Calculating a timeout value</p><p>It should be clear now why this approach is an antipattern. While this seems like a perfectly logical solution to the timeout problem, it causes <em>every request</em> from service consumers to have to wait 10 seconds just to find out the service is not responsive. Ten seconds is a long time to wait for an error. In most cases users won't wait more than 2 to 3 seconds before hitting the submit button again or giving up and closing the screen. There must be a better way to deal with server responsiveness.</p></div></div><div id="expander-52626805" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-52626805" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Using the Circuit Breaker Pattern</div><div id="expander-content-52626805" class="expand-content"><p>Rather than relying on timeout values for your remote service calls, a better approach is to use something called the <em>circuit breaker pattern</em>. This software pattern works just like a circuit breaker in your house. When it is closed, electricity flows through it, but once it is open, no electricity can pass until the breaker is closed. Similarly, if a software circuit breaker detects that a service is not responding, it will open, rejecting requests to that service. Once the service becomes responsive, the breaker will close, allowing requests through.</p><p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_203" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 2-3</a> illustrates how the circuit breaker pattern works. The circuit breaker continually monitors the remote service, ensuring that it is alive and responsive (more on that part later). While the service remains responsive the breaker will be closed, allowing requests through. If the remote service suddenly becomes unresponsive, the circuit breaker opens, thus preventing requests from going through until the service once again becomes responsive. However, unlike the circuit breaker in your house, a software circuit breaker can continue monitoring the service and close itself once the remote service becomes responsive again.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image iimagestimeout-3png confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="250" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0203-f6181a9a1ef2e1cf22272aa45b15c0fd.png" data-image-src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0203-f6181a9a1ef2e1cf22272aa45b15c0fd.png"></p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><span class="label">Figure 2-3. Circuit breaker pattern</p><p>Depending on the implementation, the service consumer will always check with the circuit breaker first to see if it is open or closed. This can also be done through an interceptor pattern so the service consumer doesn't need to know the circuit breaker is in the request path. In either case, the significant advantage of the circuit breaker pattern over timeout values is that the service consumer knows right away that the service has become unresponsive rather than having to wait for the timeout value. In the prior example, if a circuit breaker was used instead of the timeout value, the service consumer would know within milliseconds that the trade-placement service was not responsive rather than having to wait 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds) to get the same information. </p><p>Circuit breakers can monitor the remote service in several ways. The simplest way is to do a simple heartbeat check on the remote service (e.g., ping). While this is relatively easy and inexpensive, all it does is tell the circuit breaker that the remote service is alive, but says nothing as to the responsiveness of the actual service request. To get better information about the responsiveness of the request you can use synthetic transactions. A synthetic transaction is another monitoring technique circuit breakers can use where a fake transaction is periodically sent to the service (e.g., once every 10 seconds). The fake transaction performs all of the functionality required within that service, allowing the circuit breaker to gain an accurate measure of responsiveness. Synthetic transactions can be very tricky and difficult to implement in that all parts of the application or system need to know about the synthetic transaction. A third type of monitoring is real-time user monitoring, where actual production transactions are monitored for responsiveness. Once a threshold is reached, the breaker moves into what is called a half-open state, where only a certain number of transactions are let through (say 1 out of 10). Once the service responsiveness goes back to normal, the breaker is then closed, allowing all transactions through. </p><p>There are several open source implementations of the circuit breaker pattern, including Hystrix from Netflix and a plethora of GitHub implementations. The <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.akka.io/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Akka framework</a> includes a circuit breaker implementation as part of the framework implemented through the Akka <code>CircuitBreaker</code> class.</p></div></div><div id="expander-429074790" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-429074790" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>The &quot;I Was Taught to Share&quot; AntiPattern</div><div id="expander-content-429074790" class="expand-content"><p>Microservices is known as a &quot;share-nothing&quot; architecture.

For example, rather than having a security service that is responsible for authentication and authorization, you might have the source code and security functionality wrapped in a JAR file named <em>security.jar</em> that all services use.

This helps preserve the bounded context of each service, which is what gives you the ability to do quick testing and deployment. With microservices it all boils down to change control and dependencies. The more dependencies you have between services, the harder it is to isolate service changes, making it difficult to separately test and deploy individual services.

While this makes it easy to change and develop software, it is my least favorite sharing technique because it causes potential issues and surprises during runtime, making applications less robust. The main issue with the shared project technique is that of communication and control—it is difficult to know what shared modules changed and why, and also hard to control whether you want that particular change or not. Imagine being ready to release your microservice just to find out someone made a breaking change to a shared module, requiring you to change and retest your code prior to deployment.</p><p>A better approach if you have to share code is to use a shared library (e.g., .NET assembly or JAR file). This approach makes development more difficult because for each change made to a module in a shared library, the developer must first create the library, then restart the service, and then retest. However, the advantage of the shared library technique is that libraries can be versioned, providing better control over the deployment and runtime behavior of a service. If a change is made to a shared library and versioned, the service owner can make decisions about when to incorporate that change.</p><p>A third technique that is common in a microservices architecture is to violate the don't-repeat-yourself (DRY) principle and replicate the shared module across all services needing that particular functionality. While the replication technique may seem risky, it avoids dependency sharing and preserves the bounded context of a service. Problems arise with this technique when the replicated module needs to be changed, particularly for a defect. In this case all services need to change. Therefore, this technique is only really useful for very stable shared modules that have little or no change.</p><p>A fourth technique that is sometimes possible is to use service consolidation. Let's say two or three services are all sharing some common code, and those common modules frequently change. Since all of the services must be tested and deployed with the common module change anyway, you might as well just consolidate the functionality into a single service, thereby removing the dependent library.</p><p>One word of advice regarding shared libraries—avoid combining all of your shared code into a single shared library like <em>common.jar</em>. Using a common library makes it difficult to know whether you need to incorporate the shared code and when. A better technique is to separate your shared libraries into ones that have context. For example, create context-based libraries like <em>security.jar</em>, <em>persistence.jar</em>, <em>dateutils.jar</em>, and so on. This separates code that doesn't change often from code that changes frequently, making it easier to determine whether or not to incorporate the change right away and what the context of the change was.</p></div></div><div id="expander-471765768" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-471765768" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Reach-in Reporting AntiPattern</div><div id="expander-content-471765768" class="expand-content"><p>With the microservices architecture style, services and the corresponding data are contained within a single bounded context, meaning that the data is typically migrated to separate databases (or schemas).

The first three techniques pull data from each of the service databases, hence the antipattern name &quot;reach-in reporting.&quot; Since the first three models represent the problem associated with this antipattern, let's take a look at those techniques first to see why they lead you into trouble.</p></div></div><div id="expander-2139077687" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-2139077687" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Issues with Microservices Reporting</div><div id="expander-content-2139077687" class="expand-content"><p>The problem with reporting is two-fold: how do you obtain reporting data in a timely manner and still maintain the bounded context between the service and its data?

This is a typical implementation of the shared database integration style, which couples applications together through a shared database. This means that the services no longer own their data. Any service database schema change or database refactoring must include reporting service modifications as well, breaking that important bounded context between the service and the data.</p><p>The way to avoid the issue of data coupling is to use another technique called the <em>HTTP pull model</em>. With this model, rather than accessing each service database directly, the reporting service makes a restful HTTP call to each service, asking for its data.

How big should a service be? How small should it be? Choosing the right level of granularity for your services is critical to the success of any microservices effort. Service granularity can impact performance, robustness, reliability, change control, testability, and even deployment.</p><p>The <em>grains of sand pitfall</em> occurs when architects and developers create services that are too fined-grained. Wait—isn't that why it's called <em>micro</em>services in the first place? The word &quot;micro&quot; implies that a service should be very small, but how small is &quot;small&quot;?</p><p>One of the primary reasons this pitfall occurs is because developers often confuse a <em>service</em> with a <em>class</em>. Too many times I've seen development teams create services by thinking that the implementation class they're writing is actually the service. Nothing could be further from the truth. </p><p>A service should always be thought of as a <em>service component</em>. A service component is a component of the architecture that performs a specific function in the system. The service component should have a clear and concise roles and responsibility statement and have a well-defined set of operations. It is up to the developer to decide <em>how</em> the service component should be implemented and how many implementation classes are needed for the service.</p><p>As <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_501" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 5-1</a> shows, a service component is implemented through one or more modules (e.g., Java classes). Implementing a service component using a one-to-one relationship between a module and a service component not only lends itself toward components that are too fine-grained, it also leads to poor programming practices as well. Services implemented through a single class tend to have classes that are too big and carry too much responsibility, making them hard to maintain and test.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image iimagessand-1png confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="250" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0501-664db0319ecaca44fe861eb5f617bb32.png" data-image-src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0501-664db0319ecaca44fe861eb5f617bb32.png"></p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><span class="label">Figure 5-1. Relationship between modules and a service</p><p>The number of implementation classes should not be a defining characteristic for determining the granularity of a service. Some services may only need a single class file to implement all of the business functionality, whereas others may need six or more classes.</p><p>If the number of implementation classes has no impact on the granularity of a service, then what does? Fortunately, there are three basic tests you can use to determine the right level of granularity for your services: the service scope and functionality, the need for database transactions, and finally the level of service choreography.</p></div></div><div id="expander-2101381227" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-2101381227" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Analyzing Service Scope and Function</div><div id="expander-content-2101381227" class="expand-content"><p>The first way to determine whether your services have the right level of granularity is to analyze the scope and function of the service. What does the service do? What are its operations? Documenting or verbally stating the service scope and function is a great way to determine if the service is doing too much. Using words like &quot;and&quot; and &quot;in addition&quot; is usually a good indicator that the service is probably doing too much.</p><p>Cohesion also plays a role with regards to the service scope and function. Cohesion is defined as the degree and manner to which the operations of the service are interrelated. You want to strive for strong cohesion within your services. For example, let's say you have a customer service with the following operations:</p><ul><li>add_customer</li><li>update_customer</li><li>get_customer</li><li>notify_customer</li><li>record_customer_comments</li><li>get_customer_comments</li></ul><p>In this example the first three operations are interrelated as they all pertain to maintaining and retrieving customer information. However, the last three (notify_customer, record_customer_comments, and get_customer_comments) do not relate to basic CRUD operations on basic customer data. In analyzing the level of cohesion of the operations in this service, it becomes clear that the original service should perhaps be split into three separate services (customer maintenance, customer notification, and customer comments).</p><p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_502" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 5-2</a> illustrates the point that, in general, when analyzing the service scope and function you will likely find that your services are too coarse-grained and you will move toward services that are more fine-grained.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image iimagessand-2png confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0502-9be9f37a8cf617b1fda9e83ff72847c8.png" data-image-src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0502-9be9f37a8cf617b1fda9e83ff72847c8.png"></p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><span class="label">Figure 5-2. Impact of analyzing service functionality and scope</p><p>Sam Newman offers some good solid advice in this area—start out more coarse-grained and move to fine-grained as you learn more about the service.

Database transactions are more formally referred to as ACID transactions (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability). ACID transactions coordinate multiple database updates into a single unit of work. The database updates are either committed as a whole unit or rolled back if an error condition occurs.</p><p>Because services in a microservices architecture are distributed and deployed as separate applications, it is extremely difficult to maintain an ACID transaction between two or more remote services. For this reason, microservices architectures generally rely on a technique known as BASE transactions (basic availability, soft state, and eventual consistency). Regardless, there will usually be times where you do require an ACID transaction for certain business operations. If you find you are constantly battling issues surrounding ACID vs. BASE transactions and you need to coordinate multiple updates, chances are you have made your services too fine-grained.</p><p>When analyzing your transaction needs and find that you can't live with eventual consistency you will generally move from fine-grained services to more coarse-grained ones, thereby keeping multiple updates coordinated within a single service context, as illustrated in <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_503" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 5-3</a>.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image iimagessand-3png confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="250" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0503-be24bd98df9293d6521d884c01eb922f.png" data-image-src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0503-be24bd98df9293d6521d884c01eb922f.png"></p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><span class="label">Figure 5-3. Impact of analyzing database transactions</p><p>Notice that from an ACID transaction standpoint it doesn't matter whether you consolidate the separate databases or keep them as individual ones.

Service choreography refers to the communication between services, also commonly referred to as inter-service communication. Service choreography is generally something you want to be careful of within in a microservices architecture. First of all, it decreases the overall performance of your application since each call to another service is a remote call. For example, assuming it takes 100 milliseconds to make a restful call to another service, making five remote service calls is a half a second spent <em>just in remote access time</em>.</p><p>The other issue with too much service choreography is that it can impact the overall reliability and robustness of your system. The more remote calls you make for a single business request, the better the chances are that one of those remote calls will fail or time out.</p><p>If you find you are having to communicate with too many services to complete single business requests, then you've probably made your services too fine-grained. When analyzing the level of service choreography, you will generally move from fine-grained services to ones that are more coarse-grained, as illustrated in <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_504" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 5-4</a>.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image iimagessand-4png confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="400" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0504-582836e8a516762ca9e6bbea1e8e7562.png" data-image-src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0504-582836e8a516762ca9e6bbea1e8e7562.png"></p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><span class="label">Figure 5-4. Impact of analyzing service choreography</p><p>By consolidating services and moving to more coarse-grained services you can improve performance and increase the overall reliability and robustness of your applications.

Executing multiple requests at the same time increases overall responsiveness, allowing you to coordinate multiple services in a single business request in a timely fashion. The key point here is to understand and analyze the trade-offs associated with service choreography to ensure both sufficient responsiveness to the user and sufficient overall reliability of your system.</p></div></div><div id="expander-180550477" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-180550477" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Developer Without a Cause Pitfall</div><div id="expander-content-180550477" class="expand-content"><p>I first saw James Dean in the movie <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em> when I was just a young lad, but I still remember everything about the movie.

Every architect and developer on the team should know the answer to each of the following questions:</p><ul><li>Why are you doing microservices?</li><li>What are the primary business drivers?</li><li>What architecture characteristics are most important?</li></ul><p>Using deployability, performance, robustness, and scalability as the primary architecture characteristics, consider the following scenarios where the business driver is known.

Referring back to <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_601" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 6-1</a>, given this driver the developer would have actually made the wrong decision to consolidate services.</p><p><strong><em>Scenario 2: The reason for moving to microservices is to increase the overall reliability and robustness of the application.</em></strong></p><p>This scenario is a common reason for companies moving from monolithic applications to a microservices architecture, primarily due to issues with monolithic architectures surrounding tight coupling and hence brittle applications.

While the microservices architecture is a very powerful and popular architecture style, it's not suited for every application or environment.</p><p>You can easily avoid this pitfall by first understanding the advantages and disadvantages of microservices. Then, once you've gained a full understanding of what microservices is all about, you can match your business needs and goals to the architectural characteristics to determine if microservices is a fit for your situation and organization. You can also avoid this pitfall by learning more about other architecture patterns that may be a better fit for your situation</p><h2 id="MicroserviceArchitecture-AdvantagesandDisadvantages">Advantages and Disadvantages</h2><p>The first step in avoiding this pitfall is to understand the advantages and disadvantages of the microservices architecture style. The following are some of the more important advantages you should know about:</p><p>DeploymentEase of deployment is one of the primary drivers for moving to a microservices architecture. Microservices are small, single-purpose services deployed as separate applications. It is significantly easier and far less risk to deploy a single service than an entire monolithic application. As a matter of fact, the whole notion of continuous delivery is in part what prompted the creation of the microservices architecture style.TestabilityEase of testing is another big advantage of the microservices architecture. The small scope of a service coupled with the lack of shared dependencies with other services makes them relatively easy to test. However, perhaps one of the more significant aspects of this characteristic is that with microservices you have the ability to do more complete regression testing than with bigger monolithic applications.Change controlWith microservices it is easier to control what gets changed when adding new functionality. This is again due to the limited service scope and the bounded context maintained by each service. Having small, independent services with few inter-dependencies means less coordination for developing, testing, and releasing changes.ModularityMicroservices is a highly modular architecture style, which in turn leads to highly agile applications. Agility is best defined as the ability to respond quickly to change. The more modular an architecture, the faster the ability to develop, test, and release changes. The microservices architecture style is perhaps the most modular architecture out of all the architecture patterns due to the fine level of service granularity.ScalabilityBecause microservices are fine-grained single-purpose services that are separately deployed, this architecture style boasts the highest level of scalability out of all the architecture patterns. It is relatively easy to scale out a particular piece of functionality with the microservices architecture style, in part due to the containerized nature of the service topology and sophisticated monitoring tools that allow you to start and stop services dynamically through automation.</p><p>While these advantages might convince you that microservices is the best solution for your situation, consider the following list of disadvantages.</p><p>Organizational change Microservices requires organizational change at many levels. Development teams must be restructured and reorganized into more cross-functional teams so that small teams can own the end-to-end technical aspects of the services they are responsible for, including the user interface, backend processing, rules processing, and database processing and modeling. The traditional corporate development team model of user interface teams, backend development teams, and database engineers/administrators simply doesn't work with a microservices architecture. In addition, the organizational structures involved with releasing software must also change. With microservices it is not feasible to use the traditional software development lifecycle procedures that exist with monolithic, layered architectures. Rather, you must embrace automation and leverage devops tools and practices to develop an effective deployment pipeline for releasing microservices. PerformanceBecause every microservice is a separately deployed application, communication to and from services, as well as communication between services, is remote. Performance can be significantly impacted depending on your environment and the amount of service choreography you have in your microservices application. It is important to understand your remote access latency (see &quot;Are We There Yet Pitfall&quot;) and also how much service communication you will need (see Grains of Sand Pitfall) to fully understand the performance impacts of using microservices. ReliabilityFor the same reasons that performance can be impacted by using microservices, the same is true with overall reliability. Because every request is a remote access call, you run the risk that one of the services you need to communicate with to complete a single business request is not available or fails to respond.DevOpsWith the microservices architecture you can have anywhere from hundreds to even thousands of microservices. Due to the large number of services you might have, it is simply not feasible to manually manage hundreds of concurrent release cycles and deployments. Automation and continuous collaboration between developers, testers, and release engineers is vital to the success of any microservices endeavor. For this reason you need to embrace various operations-related tools and practices, which can be a very complicated task. There are about 12 different categories of operations-related tools and frameworks used within a microservices architecture, and each of those categories contains several dozen tool and product choices. For example, there are monitoring tools, service registry and discovery tools, deployment tools, and so on. Which ones are best for your environment and situation? The answer to this question requires several months of research, proof-of-concept efforts, and tradeoff analysis to determine the best combination of tools and frameworks for your application and environment.</p></div></div><div id="expander-1030698996" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1030698996" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Matching Business Needs</div><div id="expander-content-1030698996" class="expand-content"><p>After understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the microservices architecture style, you must then analyze your business needs and goals to determine if microservices is the right approach for the problem you are trying to solve.

Another thing you can do to avoid this pitfall is to understand and analyze other architecture patterns to determine if one of those might be a better fit for your situation.</p><p>Besides microservices there are seven other common architecture patterns you might want to consider for your application or system:</p><ul><li>Service-Based Architecture</li><li>Service-Oriented Architecture</li><li>Layered Architecture</li><li>Microkernel Architecture</li><li>Space-Based Architecture</li><li>Event-Driven Architecture</li><li>Pipeline Architecture</li></ul><p>Of course, you don't have to select one single architecture pattern for your application.

A contract usually contains a schema specifying the expected input and output data, and sometimes the name of the operation (depending on how you are implementing your service). Contracts are usually owned by the service, and can be represented through formats like XML, JSON, or even a Java or C# object. And of course, those contracts never change, right? Wrong.</p><p>The static contract pitfall occurs when you fail to version your service contracts from the very start, or even not at all. Contract versioning is absolutely critical for not only avoiding breaking changes (changing a contract and breaking all consumers using that contract), but also to maintain agility by supporting backward compatibility.</p><p>Here's an example that illustrates how you can get into trouble by not versioning your contracts. Assume you have a microservice that is accessed by three different clients (client 1, client 2, and client 3). Client 1 would like to make a change to the service contract right away. You check with client 2 and client 3 to see if they can accommodate the change, and both clients inform you that it will take weeks to implement that change due to other things going on with those clients. Now you must inform client 1 that it will take weeks to make that change because you need to coordinate the update with clients 2 and 3. However, client 1 cannot wait weeks.</p><p>By providing versioning in your contracts, and hence providing backward compatibility, you can now be more agile in terms of client 1's request. Agility is defined as how fast you can respond to change. If you properly versioned your contracts from the very start, you could immediately respond to client 1's request for the contract change by simply creating a new version of the contract, say version 1.1. Clients 2 and 3 are both using version 1.0 of the contract, so now you can implement the change right away without having to wait for client 2 or client 3 to respond. In addition, you can make the change without making what is called a &quot;breaking change.&quot;</p><p>There are two basic techniques for contract versioning: versioning at the header level and versioning in the contract schema itself. In this chapter I will cover each of these techniques in detail, but first let's look at an example.</p></div></div><div id="expander-1678409982" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1678409982" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Changing a Contract</div><div id="expander-content-1678409982" class="expand-content"><p>To illustrate the problem with not versioning a contract I will use an example of buying a certain number of shares of Apple common stock (AAPL).

    &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#&quot;,
    &quot;properties&quot;: {
      &quot;acct&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;number&quot;},
      &quot;cusip&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;},
      &quot;shares&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;number&quot;, &quot;minimum&quot;: 100}
   },
    &quot;required&quot;: [&quot;acct&quot;, &quot;cusip&quot;, &quot;shares&quot;]
}</pre><p>In this case to buy stock you must specify the brokerage account (<em>acct</em>), the stock you wish to purchase in CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures) format (<em>cusip</em>), and finally the number of shares (<em>shares</em>), which must be greater than 100. All three fields are required.</p><p>The code to make a request to purchase 1000 shares of Apple stock (CUSIP 037833100) for brokerage account 12345 using REST would look like this:</p><pre>POST /trade/buy
Accept: application/json
{ &quot;acct&quot;: &quot;12345&quot;,
  &quot;cusip&quot;: &quot;037833100&quot;,
  &quot;shares&quot;: &quot;1000&quot; }</pre><p>Now let's say that the service changes its contract to accept a SEDOL (Stock Exchange Daily Official List) rather than a CUSIP, which is another industry standard way of identifying a particular instrument to be traded. Now the contract looks like this:</p><pre>{   
    &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#&quot;,
    &quot;properties&quot;: {
      &quot;acct&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;number&quot;},
      &quot;sedol&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;},
      &quot;shares&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;number&quot;, &quot;minimum&quot;: 100}
   },
    &quot;required&quot;: [&quot;acct&quot;, &quot;sedol&quot;, &quot;shares&quot;]
}
</pre><p>This would be considered a breaking change in that the prior client code will now fail because it is still using a CUSIP. What you need to do is use versioning so that version 1 uses a CUSIP and version 2 uses a SEDOL to identify the stock being traded.</p></div></div><div id="expander-1302393103" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1302393103" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Header Versioning</div><div id="expander-content-1302393103" class="expand-content"><p>The first technique for contract versioning is to put the contract version number in the header of the remote access protocol as illustrated in <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_801" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 8-1</a>. I like to refer to this as <em>protocol-aware contract versioning</em> because the information about the version of the contract you are using is contained within the header of the remote access protocol (e.g., REST, SOAP, AMQP, JMS, MSMQ, etc.).</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image iimagescontract1png confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0801-dba99afe9ad48007a770a13d03a90971.png" data-image-src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0801-dba99afe9ad48007a770a13d03a90971.png"></p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><span class="label">Figure 8-1. Header contract versioning</p><p>When using REST you can use what is called a <em>vendor mime type</em> to specify the version of the contract you wish to use in the accept header of the request:</p><pre>POST /trade/buy
Accept: application/vnd.svc.trade.v2+json</pre><p>By using the vendor mime type (vnd) in the accept header of the URI you can specify the version number of the contract, thereby directing the service to perform processing based on that contract version number. Correspondingly, the service will need to parse the accept header to determine the version number. One example of this would be to use a regular expression to find the version as illustrated below:</p><pre>def version
   request.headers
   [&quot;Accept&quot;][/^application/vnd.svc.trade.v(d)/, 1].to_i
end
</pre><p>Unfortunately that is the easy part; the hard part is coding all of the cyclomatic complexity into the service to provide conditional processing based on the contract version (e.g., if version 1 then... else if version 2 then...). For this reason, we need some sort of version-deprecation policy to control the level of cyclomatic complexity you introduce into each service.</p><p>Using messaging you will need to supply the version number in the property section of the message header. For JMS 2.0 that would look something like this:</p><pre>String msg = createJSON(
  &quot;acct&quot;,&quot;12345&quot;,
  &quot;sedol&quot;,&quot;2046251&quot;,
  &quot;shares&quot;,&quot;1000&quot;)};

jmsContext.createProducer()
.setProperty(&quot;version&quot;, 2)
.send(queue, msg);
</pre><p>Each messaging standard will have its own way of setting this header. The important thing to remember here is that regardless of the messaging standard, the version property is a string value that needs to match exactly with what the service is expecting, including being case-sensitive. For this reason it's generally not a good idea to supply a default version if the version number cannot be found in the header.</p></div></div><div id="expander-952369677" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-952369677" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Schema Versioning</div><div id="expander-content-952369677" class="expand-content"><p>Another contract-versioning technique is adding the version number to the actual schema itself. This technique is illustrated in <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_802" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 8-2</a>. I usually refer to this technique as <em>protocol-agnostic contract versioning</em> because the version identification is completely independent of the remote access protocol. Nothing needs to be specified in the headers of the remote access protocol in order to use versioning.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image iimagescontract2png confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0802-d3d57571e3ffca3dcc869c7b0c692548.png" data-image-src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0802-d3d57571e3ffca3dcc869c7b0c692548.png"></p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><span class="label">Figure 8-2. Schema-based contract versioning</p><p>By using schema-based versioning, the schema used in the previous example would look like this:</p><pre>{   
    &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#&quot;,
    &quot;properties&quot;: {
      &quot;version&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;},
      &quot;acct&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;number&quot;},
      &quot;cusip&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;},
      &quot;sedol&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;},
      &quot;shares&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;number&quot;, &quot;minimum&quot;: 100}
   },
    &quot;required&quot;: [&quot;version&quot;, &quot;acct&quot;, &quot;shares&quot;]
}
</pre><p>Notice that the the schema actually contains the version number field (<em>version</em>) as an integer value. Because you only have one schema now, you will need to add all of the combinations of possibilities to the schema. In the example above both the CUSIP and SEDOL are added to the schema because that is what varies between the versions.</p><p>The big advantage of this technique is that the schema (including the version) is independent of the remote access protocol. This means that the same exact schema can be used by multiple protocols. For example, the same schema can be used by REST and JMS 2.0 without any modifications to the remote access protocol headers:</p><pre>POST /trade/buy
Accept: application/json
{ &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2&quot;,
  &quot;acct&quot;: &quot;12345&quot;,
  &quot;sedol&quot;: &quot;2046251&quot;,
  &quot;shares&quot;: &quot;1000&quot; }


String msg = createJSON(
  &quot;version&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,
  &quot;acct&quot;,&quot;12345&quot;,
  &quot;sedol&quot;,&quot;2046251&quot;,
  &quot;shares&quot;,&quot;1000&quot;)};
jmsContext.createProducer().send(queue, msg);
</pre><p>Unfortunately this technique has a lot of disadvantages associated with it. First, you must parse the actual payload of the message to extract the version number. This precludes using things like XML appliances (e.g., DataPower) to do routing, and also might present issues when trying to parse the schema (particularly with XML). Secondly, the schemas can get quite complex, making it difficult to do automated conversions of the schema (e.g., JSON to Java object). Finally, custom validations may be required in the service to validate the schema. In the example above, the service would have to validate that either the CUSIP or SEDOL is filled in based on the version number.</p></div></div><div id="expander-1783465666" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1783465666" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Are We There Yet Pitfall</div><div id="expander-content-1783465666" class="expand-content"><p>With the microservices architecture every service is deployed as a separate application, meaning all of the communication to a microservice from the client or API layer, as well as communication between services, requires a remote call.</p><p>This pitfall occurs when you don't know how long the remote access call takes. You might assume the latency it around 50 milliseconds, but have you ever measured it? Do you know what the average latency is for your particular environment? Do you know what the &quot;long tail&quot; latency is (e.g., 95, 99, 99.5 percentiles) for your environment? Measuring both of these metrics is important, because even with good average latency, bad long-tail latency can destroy you.</p></div></div><div id="expander-1510822684" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1510822684" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Measuring Latency</div><div id="expander-content-1510822684" class="expand-content"><p>Measuring the remote access latency under load in your production environment (or production-like environment) is critical for understanding the performance profile of your application. For example, let's say a particular business request requires the coordination of four microservices. Assuming that your remote access latency is 100 milliseconds, that particular business request would consume 500 milliseconds just in remote access latency alone (the initial request plus four remote calls between services). That is a half a second of request time without one single line of source code being executed for the actual business request processing. Most applications simply cannot absorb that sort of latency.</p><p>You might think the way to avoid this pitfall is to simply measure and determine your average latency for your chosen remote access protocol (e.g., REST). However, that only provides you with one piece of information—the average latency of the particular remote access protocol you are using. The other task is to investigate the comparative latency using other remote access protocols such as Java Message Service (JMS), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ).</p></div></div><div id="expander-371937393" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-371937393" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Comparing Protocols</div><div id="expander-content-371937393" class="expand-content"><p>The comparative latency will vary greatly based on both your environment and the nature of the business request, so it is important to establish these benchmarks on a variety of business requests with different load profiles.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image iimageslatency1png image confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0901-c8ab60023fcfbfd715852085a98198c3.png" data-image-src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/mapr_0901-c8ab60023fcfbfd715852085a98198c3.png"></p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><span class="label">Figure 9-1. Comparing remote access latency</p><p>In looking at the hypothetical example in <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_901" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 9-1</a> you notice that AMQP is in fact almost twice as fast as REST.

It's so common a choice that most of the popular template frameworks (e.g., DropWizard, Spring Boot, etc.) have REST access already built into the service templates. If REST is such a popular choice, then why is it a pitfall? The give it a rest pitfall is about using REST as the only communication protocol and ignoring the power of messaging to enhance your microservices architecture. For example, in a RESTful microservices architecture, how would you handle asynchronous communications? What about the need for broadcast capabilities? What do you do if you need to manage multiple remote RESTful calls within a transactional unit of work?</p><p>There are two types of messaging standards you should be aware of when considering using messaging for your microservices architecture—platform-specific standards and platform-independent standards. Platform-specific standards include the JMS for the Java platform and MSMQ for the .NET platform. Both describe a standard API used within the platform, independent of the messaging provider (vendor) you are using. For example, in the Java platform you can swap out brokers (e.g., ActiveMQ, HornetQ, etc.) with no API changes. While the API is standard and remains the same, it's the underlying proprietary protocol between these brokers that is different (which is why you need to have the same client JAR and server JAR for the same vendor). With platform-standard messaging protocols you are more concerned about portability via a common API rather than the actual vendor product you are using or the wire-level protocols used.</p><p>The current platform-independent standard is AMQP. AMQP, which standardizes on the wire-level protocol, not the API. This allows heterogeneous platforms to communicate with one another, regardless of the vendor product you are using. A client using RabbitMQ, for example, can easily communicate with a StormMQ server (assuming they are using the same protocol version). AMQP using RabbitMQ is currently the most popular choice for messaging within a microservices architecture, mostly because of its platform-independent nature.</p></div></div><div id="expander-714656173" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-714656173" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Asynchronous Requests</div><div id="expander-content-714656173" class="expand-content"><p>The first consideration for using messaging within your microservices architecture is asynchronous communication. With asynchronous requests the service caller does not need to wait for a response from the service when making a request, as illustrated in <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#fig_1001" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Figure 10-1</a>.

Performance is increased because callers don't have to wait for a response if none is needed. Through guaranteed delivery, the message broker ensures that the service will eventually receive the message. Reliability is increased because the caller doesn't need to worry about setting timeout values or using the circuit breaker pattern when communicating with a service (see <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls#the_timeout_antipattern" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">The Timeout AntiPattern</a>).</p></div></div><div id="expander-596169323" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-596169323" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Broadcast Capabilities</div><div id="expander-content-596169323" class="expand-content"><p>Another very powerful feature of messaging that is not available within REST is the capability to broadcast a message to multiple services.

The message producer generally doesn't know who is accepting the message or what they are going to do with it. For example, a message producer may broadcast a message informing consumers about a stock split for Apple stock (AAPL). The message producer only has the responsibility of publishing a message to a topic (JMS), a fanout or topic exchange (AMQP), or a multicast queue (MSMQ). The stock split message may be picked up by any number of consumers, or no consumers at all.</p></div></div><div id="expander-703804955" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-703804955" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Transacted Requests</div><div id="expander-content-703804955" class="expand-content"><p>Messaging systems support the notion of transacted messages, meaning that if messages are sent to multiple queues or topics within the context of a transaction, the messages are not actually received by the services until the sender does a commit on that transaction.

Having to constantly train and retrain staff not only robs your department of momentum, it makes your company lose the skilled and effective employees it once had for second runner ups and under-qualified people, which then affects the company’s bottom line and destroys morale. Friendships are made and destroyed, and eventually, this will crush the spirit of your staff. </p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Micromanagement leads to employees quitting.</p></div></div><div id="expander-1564201389" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1564201389" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Lack of Autonomy</div><div id="expander-content-1564201389" class="expand-content"><p>When you micromanage, your employees begin to feel like they’re losing their autonomy. When this happens, they’ll slowly lose the desire to do anything but that which you demand, and little more. No one will step outside the proverbial box or go the extra mile for a task. You hand those same people a certain level of autonomy and they will take pride in what they do and how they do it. </p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> A lack of autonomy will squelch growth in your employees. One of the goals of management should be to see staff members rise in the ranks.</p></div></div><div id="expander-2098314501" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-2098314501" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>No Innovation</div><div id="expander-content-2098314501" class="expand-content"><p>One of the biggest dangers of micromanaging is crushing your employees’ creative spirit. Your team is on the front lines of your project and they know what is happening better than anyone else, including you. While some innovations that they bring to the table might not always be winners, crushing innovation and creativity destroys all chances of the good ideas coming out and being shared. By refusing to take risks in innovation, you’re also refusing the potential for progress. </p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Innovation is the key to progress. Micromanaging your team ruins any chance of growth or progression. </p><p>If you find yourself micromanaging, you can fix it. You have to have trust and faith in the people that you work with, and believe that they can get the job done even without your constant oversight. With more freedom, they will surprise you with an increase in creativity, innovation, and productivity. </p></div></div>

Firstly, we need to plan what we need to move – this list may include furniture, gadgets, and a bunch of other things. We might as well split the tasks into moving everything in two or more attempts. Once we have moved everything, the next step is to place all this stuff at suitable places.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, while moving from the monolithic architecture to the microservices architecture, we have to analyze and devise a plan for each service. Deciding the granularity of applications is another tedious task when it comes to migration from one architecture to another. On the other hand, some software systems are too small to be broken down any further. These are probably subsystems that are already broken down as much as they should be and breaking them down further will do no good. If there is a broad spectrum of applications and services that we are handling, it would make the task even more difficult.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">And that’s not all… once we have moved the applications, we will have to move the data associated with all these applications. So, there is no real need for microservices unless the complexity factor is very high.</p></div></div><div id="expander-1359854354" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-1359854354" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Sharing is Caring</div><div id="expander-content-1359854354" class="expand-content"><p style="text-align: justify;">First things first – microservices is a “no sharing” architecture and involves a lot of authentication and authorizations for services to be able to communicate. We will have to find out from the DevOps team if there are any systems or services that are interdependent or function efficiently only when put together. For example, two or more services may be using the same code or the same database. Clubbing up such services might be a wiser approach rather than splitting them up because sometimes doing so may increase the overall complexity rather than decreasing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, splitting up dependent legacy systems into microservices might require long-term strategic planning, which might add to the time, cost, and efforts. From my experience, a rule that applies to all the microservices is, the more the number of dependencies, the harder it is to isolate these services. Furthermore, if there are versioning issues with some of these services, things can get worse.</p></div></div><div id="expander-156064317" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-156064317" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Keep trying till you succeed</div><div id="expander-content-156064317" class="expand-content"><p style="text-align: justify;">The service request generated at a customer’s end is handled by a service component depending on the availability of the requested service and how the service component responds after receiving this request. In this case, the user needs to send the request (which needs to reach the service component) and the service component needs to send back the correct response (which must reach the user). If delays are introduced in the request or response times, they are because the user and the service component keep retrying.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, neither the user nor the service component will keep trying forever. There is a timeout value set, after which, both have to stop retrying. So where’s the trick? It’s with setting up an appropriate timeout value. When I say appropriate, the timeout values can be low for services that are less critical and they must be kept high for highly critical services such as financial transactions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But is it an ideal thing to do? Well, I don’t think so! Using circuit breaker software, in my opinion, is a much better approach. The circuit breaker will act as a mediator to keep a check on whether the service is available or not in a timely manner. It will disallow requests to a service when it is unavailable and start allowing requests to the service when it becomes available again.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In microservices, all of the services are deployed separately and are accessed remotely. Managing service availability &amp; responsiveness with software tools such as the circuit breaker becomes a major challenge for the microservice architecture due to its distributed structure.</p></div></div><div id="expander-2136904512" class="expand-container"><div id="expander-control-2136904512" class="expand-control"><span class="expand-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-chevron-down"><span>Jumping on the Microservices bandwagon</div><div id="expander-content-2136904512" class="expand-content"><p style="text-align: justify;">Choosing the right architecture is obviously the best thing to do but jumping on the Microservices bandwagon right away may not be a great idea. We should not ignore aspects like good coding, the level of automation, design requirements, maintainability, and testability, among others. Things can go haywire if these critical aspects are not taken care of before achieving the migration goals. And taking care of such aspects might even eliminate the need for microservices.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is also very important to gauge whether your teams are equipped and capable enough to handle processes involved while migrating toward microservices and then the maintenance of the overall architecture. Consulting and gaining insights from your DevOps team will also give you a better understanding of whether you should adopt microservices or not.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Microservices are a boon for software architects and developers but these are a few things that you must consider before resorting to microservices. Every architecture has its pros &amp; cons and microservices are no different. I hope this article was insightful enough to take care of your concerns regarding migration toward the microservices architecture.</p></div></div>
