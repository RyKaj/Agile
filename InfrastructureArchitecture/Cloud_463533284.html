<p>An Overview Cloud computing is a computing paradigm, where a large pool of systems are connected in private or public networks, to provide dynamically scalable infrastructure for application, data and file storage. With the advent of this technology, the cost of computation, application hosting, content storage and delivery is reduced significantly. Cloud computing is a practical approach to experience direct cost benefits and it has the potential to transform a data center from a capital-intensive set up to a variable priced environment. The idea of cloud computing is based on a very fundamental principal of reusability of IT capabilities. The difference that cloud computing brings compared to traditional concepts of “grid computing”, “distributed computing”, “utility computing” or “autonomic computing” is to broaden horizons across organizational boundaries. Forester defines cloud computing as: “A pool of abstracted, highly scalable, and managed compute infrastructure capable of hosting end customer applications and billed by consumption.”</p><p>Cloud Computing Models Cloud Providers offer services that can be grouped into three categories.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img height="250" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/963/1*F_EB3zGRdsahx01e8nLW4w.png" data-image-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/963/1*F_EB3zGRdsahx01e8nLW4w.png"></p><p><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong>: In this model, a complete application is offered to the customer, as a service on demand. A single instance of the service runs on the cloud &amp; multiple end users are serviced. On the customers‟ side, there is no need for upfront investment in servers or software licenses, while for the provider, the costs are lowered, since only a single application needs to be hosted &amp; maintained. Today SaaS is offered by companies such as Google, Salesforce, Microsoft, Zoho, etc.</p><p><strong>Platform as a Service (Paas)</strong>: Here, a layer of software, or development environment is encapsulated &amp; offered as a service, upon which other higher levels of service can be built. The customer has the freedom to build his own applications, which run on the provider‟s infrastructure. To meet manageability and scalability requirements of the applications, PaaS providers offer a predefined combination of OS and application servers, such as LAMP platform (Linux, Apache, MySql and PHP), restricted J2EE, Ruby etc. Google’s App Engine, <a href="http://Force.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Force.com</a>, etc are some of the popular PaaS examples.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)</strong>: IaaS provides basic storage and computing capabilities as standardized services over the network. Servers, storage systems, networking equipment, data centre space etc. are pooled and made available to handle workloads. The customer would typically deploy his own software on the infrastructure. Some common examples are Amazon, GoGrid, 3 Tera, etc.</p><p>Understanding Public and Private Clouds Enterprises can choose to deploy applications on Public, Private or Hybrid clouds. Cloud Integrators can play a vital part in determining the right cloud path for each organization. Public Cloud are owned and operated by third parties; they deliver superior economies of scale to customers, as the infrastructure costs are spread among a mix of users, giving each individual client an attractive low-cost “Pay-as-you-go” model. All customers share the same infrastructure pool with limited configuration, security protections, and availability variances. These are managed and supported by the cloud provider. One of the advantages of a Public cloud is that they may be larger than an enterprises cloud, thus providing the ability to scale seamlessly, on demand. Private Cloud Private clouds are built exclusively for a single enterprise. They aim to address concerns on data security and offer greater control, which is typically lacking in a public cloud.</p><p>There are two variations to a private cloud: On-premise &amp; Private Cloud</p><ol><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong>On-premise</strong> private clouds, also known as internal clouds are hosted within one’s own data center. This model provides a more standardized process and protection, but is limited in aspects of size and scalability. IT departments would also need to incur the capital and operational costs for the physical resources. This is best suited for applications which require complete control and configurability of the infrastructure and security.</li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Externally hosted <strong>Private Cloud</strong>: This type of private cloud is hosted externally with a cloud provider, where the provider facilitates an exclusive cloud environment with full guarantee of privacy. This is best suited for enterprises that don’t prefer a public cloud due to sharing of physical resources.</li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong>Hybrid Cloud</strong>: Hybrid Clouds combine both public and private cloud models. With a Hybrid Cloud, service providers can utilize 3rd party Cloud Providers in a full or partial manner thus increasing the flexibility of computing. The Hybrid cloud environment is capable of providing on-demand, externally provisioned scale. The ability to augment a private cloud with the resources of a public cloud can be used to manage any unexpected surges in workload.</li></ol><p>Cloud Computing Benefits Enterprises would need to align their applications, so as to exploit the architecture models that Cloud Computing offers. Some of the typical benefits are listed below:</p><ol><li><strong>Reduced Cost</strong> — There are a number of reasons to attribute Cloud technology with lower costs. The billing model is pay as per usage; the infrastructure is not purchased thus lowering maintenance. Initial expense and recurring expenses are much lower than traditional computing.</li><li><strong>Increased Storage</strong> — With the massive Infrastructure that is offered by Cloud providers today, storage &amp; maintenance of large volumes of data is a reality. Sudden workload spikes are also managed effectively &amp; efficiently, since the cloud can scale dynamically.</li><li><strong>Flexibility</strong> — This is an extremely important characteristic. With enterprises having to adapt, even more rapidly, to changing business conditions, speed to deliver is critical. Cloud computing stresses on getting applications to market very quickly, by using the most appropriate building blocks necessary for deployment.</li></ol><p>Cloud Computing Challenges Despite its growing influence, concerns regarding cloud computing still remain. In our opinion, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and the model is worth exploring. Some common challenges are:</p><ol><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong>Data Protection</strong> — Data Security is a crucial element that warrants scrutiny. Enterprises are reluctant to buy an assurance of business data security from vendors. They fear losing data to competition and the data confidentiality of consumers. In many instances, the actual storage location is not disclosed, adding onto the security concerns of enterprises. In the existing models, firewalls across data centers (owned by enterprises) protect this sensitive information. In the cloud model, Service providers are responsible for maintaining data security and enterprises would have to rely on them.</li><li><strong>Data Recovery and Availability</strong> — All business applications have Service level agreements that are stringently followed. Operational teams play a key role in management of service level agreements and runtime governance of applications. In production environments, operational teams support Appropriate clustering and Fail over Data Replication System monitoring (Transactions monitoring, logs monitoring and others) Maintenance (Runtime Governance) Disaster recovery Capacity and performance management If, any of the above mentioned services is under-served by a cloud provider, the damage &amp; impact could be severe.</li><li><strong>Management Capabilities</strong> — Despite there being multiple cloud providers, the management of platform and infrastructure is still in its infancy. Features like Auto-scaling for example, are a crucial requirement for many enterprises. There is huge potential to improve on the scalability and load balancing features provided today.</li><li><strong>Regulatory and Compliance Restrictions</strong> — In some of the European countries, Government regulations do not allow customer’s personal information and other sensitive information to be physically located outside the state or country. In order to meet such requirements, cloud providers need to setup a data center or a storage site exclusively within the country to comply with regulations. Having such an infrastructure may not always be feasible and is a big challenge for cloud providers. With cloud computing, the action moves to the interface that is, to the interface between service suppliers and multiple groups of service consumers. Cloud services will demand expertise in distributed services, procurement, risk assessment and service negotiation areas that many enterprises are only modestly equipped to handle.</li></ol><p><br/></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img height="250" src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-34fbe07d9311be4084f7b7b8a502a307" data-image-src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-34fbe07d9311be4084f7b7b8a502a307">  <img height="400" src="https://erpsoftwareblog.com/cloud/wp-content/uploads/4-Primary-Cloud-Deployment-Models-Infographic-Turnkey-Technologies1.png" data-image-src="https://erpsoftwareblog.com/cloud/wp-content/uploads/4-Primary-Cloud-Deployment-Models-Infographic-Turnkey-Technologies1.png"></p><h2 id="Cloud-PublicCloud">Public Cloud</h2><p>The public cloud deployment model is what typically comes to mind when we think about cloud computing. In this model, a public cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, owns all the infrastructure required to run an organization's IT workloads. Keeping with the &quot;someone else's computer&quot; trope, hosting workloads in the public cloud equates to renting as much computing power and storage space as you need from someone else's giant, infinitely powered PC.</p><p>In a recent RightScale survey of 786 technical professionals from both enterprise-level and small-to-medium businesses, 91% of respondents reported hosting at least some of their workloads (applications, document storage, etc.) in the public cloud.</p><p>Smaller organizations especially favor the public cloud over other deployment models: 44% of SMB respondents reported using public cloud exclusively, from either a single vendor or multiple.</p><p>This makes sense: hosting your workloads in the public cloud means you don't need to worry about purchasing, supporting and maintaining any costly infrastructure; instead, a giant corporation like Amazon or Microsoft takes care of it all for you while your team works on actually building things. The absence of an up-front cost removes a significant barrier to entry for smaller organizations with ambitious development goals. In the cloud, you only pay for what you need.</p><p>This turnkey approach applies to security and reliability as well. Rather than hosting operations-critical or otherwise sensitive assets on physical in-house servers (as you would in a traditional on-prem environment), you're entrusting them to a highly secure data center with more built-in redundancies than you could ever fathom. To give you an idea, Microsoft's SLA guarantees at least 99.9% availability on the vast majority of its paid services, and up to 99.99% for some critical services such as DDoS protection.</p><p>That's more than enough for a large chunk of businesses. But even 99.99% availability is insufficient for some types of organizations, especially in highly regulated fields like healthcare and government—hence the remaining three cloud deployment models.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img height="250" src="https://www.sam-solutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a-cloud-provider@2x.png" data-image-src="https://www.sam-solutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a-cloud-provider@2x.png"></p><h2 id="Cloud-PrivateCloud">Private Cloud</h2><p>As far as the end-user experience goes, there isn't much difference between public and private clouds; all those essential characteristics of cloud computing (resource pooling, on-demand self-service) we briefly mentioned earlier apply to both.</p><p>Infrastructure-wise, a private cloud is essentially a smaller-scale replica of the datacenters owned by public cloud vendors. Private cloud deployments are much more expensive than their public cloud counterparts, but they offer a variety of benefits that make the greater up-front costs worthwhile.</p><p>Businesses rarely go the public cloud-only route: in the aforementioned survey, only 3% of respondents used this model exclusively to host their cloud workloads. However, 75% reported using private cloud to some extent, hosting some workloads privately and entrusting others to public cloud providers. This is what's referred to as a hybrid cloud.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img height="250" width="230" src="https://www.sam-solutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a-private-cloud@2x.png" data-image-src="https://www.sam-solutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a-private-cloud@2x.png"></p><h2 id="Cloud-HybirdCloud">Hybird Cloud</h2><p>As its name suggests, the hybrid cloud deployment model refers to a combination of private and public clouds used to host an organization's workloads.</p><p>For many, hybrid represents the best of both worlds, which explains why a vast majority of businesses—69%, according to one survey—choose this approach. (This isn't the same thing as a multi-cloud strategy, which refers to relying on multiple cloud vendors in order to maximize availability and cost).</p><p>Depending on your needs, there are some potential downsides to a hybrid cloud deployment. Setting up a private cloud usually requires up-front investment, negating some of the cost-saving benefits of going full public. It also involves managing your own infrastructure to some extent. However, if you have a lot of legacy to support yet still wish to benefit from the public cloud for your other workloads, for instance, hybrid is often the best-case scenario.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img height="250" src="https://www.sam-solutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/hybrid-cloud@2x.png" data-image-src="https://www.sam-solutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/hybrid-cloud@2x.png"></p><h2 id="Cloud-CommunityCloud">Community Cloud</h2><p>For the sake of exhaustivity, I've included all four NIST-defined cloud deployment models in this article, but this last one is by far the least applicable to most situations. It is, however, an interesting approach.</p><p>Basically, the community cloud is run like a cooperative. In a hybrid cloud deployment, some of your workloads will be hosted in the public cloud, while others are kept in privately owned and maintained datacenters. The community cloud, on the other hand, combines aspects of the public and private cloud in a single, unified environment.</p><p>Per <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/community-cloud" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Gartner's always-handy IT glossary</a>, &quot;Community cloud computing refers to a shared cloud computing service environment that is targeted to a limited set of organizations or employees (such as banks or heads of trading firms).&quot; These groups of organizations generally share a set of interests and requirements (usually related to security, compliance and/or jurisdiction) that can't be met by any of the public cloud vendors. Instead of each building their own private cloud environment, they pool their resources in order to build a single infrastructure able to support the needs of each stakeholder. Use cases for community cloud deployments are limited, but this model comes with highly advantageous cost savings for those to which it applies.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img height="250" src="https://www.sam-solutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/community-cloud@2x.png" data-image-src="https://www.sam-solutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/community-cloud@2x.png"></p><p><br/></p>

<p>These design patterns are useful for building reliable, scalable, secure applications in the cloud.</p><p>Each pattern describes the problem that the pattern addresses, considerations for applying the pattern.  However, most of the patterns are relevant to any distributed system, whether hosted on Azure or on other cloud platforms.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><b>Cloud Development Categories</b></div><div class="panelContent">
<h2 id="Cloud-Availability">Availability</h2><p>Availability is the proportion of time that the system is functional and working, usually measured as a percentage of uptime. It can be affected by system errors, infrastructure problems, malicious attacks, and system load. Cloud applications typically provide users with a service level agreement (SLA), so applications must be designed to maximize availability.</p><h2 id="Cloud-DataManagement">Data Management</h2><p>Data management is the key element of cloud applications, and influences most of the quality attributes. Data is typically hosted in different locations and across multiple servers for reasons such as performance, scalability or availability, and this can present a range of challenges. For example, data consistency must be maintained, and data will typically need to be synchronized across different locations.</p><h2 id="Cloud-DesignandImplementation">Design and Implementation</h2><p>Good design encompasses factors such as consistency and coherence in component design and deployment, maintainability to simplify administration and development, and reusability to allow components and subsystems to be used in other applications and in other scenarios. Decisions made during the design and implementation phase have a huge impact on the quality and the total cost of ownership of cloud hosted applications and services.</p><h2 id="Cloud-Messaging">Messaging</h2><p>The distributed nature of cloud applications requires a messaging infrastructure that connects the components and services, ideally in a loosely coupled manner in order to maximize scalability. Asynchronous messaging is widely used, and provides many benefits, but also brings challenges such as the ordering of messages, poison message management, idempotency, and more.</p><h2 id="Cloud-ManagementandMonitoring">Management and Monitoring</h2><p>Cloud applications run in a remote datacenter where you do not have full control of the infrastructure or, in some cases, the operating system. This can make management and monitoring more difficult than an on-premises deployment. Applications must expose runtime information that administrators and operators can use to manage and monitor the system, as well as supporting changing business requirements and customization without requiring the application to be stopped or redeployed.</p><h2 id="Cloud-PerformanceandScalability">Performance and Scalability</h2><p>Performance is an indication of the responsiveness of a system to execute any action within a given time interval, while scalability is ability of a system either to handle increases in load without impact on performance or for the available resources to be readily increased. Cloud applications typically encounter variable workloads and peaks in activity. Predicting these, especially in a multitenant scenario, is almost impossible. Instead, applications should be able to scale out within limits to meet peaks in demand, and scale in when demand decreases. Scalability concerns not just compute instances, but other elements such as data storage, messaging infrastructure, and more.</p><h2 id="Cloud-Resiliency">Resiliency</h2><p>Resiliency is the ability of a system to gracefully handle and recover from failures. The nature of cloud hosting, where applications are often multitenant, use shared platform services, compete for resources and bandwidth, communicate over the Internet, and run on commodity hardware means there is an increased likelihood that both transient and more permanent faults will arise. Detecting failures, and recovering quickly and efficiently, is necessary to maintain resiliency.</p><h2 id="Cloud-Security">Security</h2><p>Security is the capability of a system to prevent malicious or accidental actions outside of the designed usage, and to prevent disclosure or loss of information. Cloud applications are exposed on the Internet outside trusted on-premises boundaries, are often open to the public, and may serve untrusted users. Applications must be designed and deployed in a way that protects them from malicious attacks, restricts access to only approved users, and protects sensitive data.</p><p><br/></p><div

<p>Decouple backend processing from a frontend host, where backend processing needs to be asynchronous, but the frontend still needs a clear response.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>In modern application development, it's normal for client applications — often code running in a web-client (browser) — to depend on remote APIs to provide business logic and compose functionality. These APIs may be directly related to the application or may be shared services provided by a third party. Commonly these API calls take place over the HTTP(S) protocol and follow REST semantics.</p><p>In most cases, APIs for a client application are designed to respond quickly, on the order of 100 ms or less. Many factors can affect the response latency, including:</p><ul><li>An application's hosting stack</li><li>Security components</li><li>The relative geographic location of the caller and the backend</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Current load</li><li>The size of the request payload</li><li>Processing queue length</li><li>The time for the backend to process the request</li></ul><p>Any of these factors can add latency to the response. Some can be mitigated by scaling out the backend. Others, such as network infrastructure, are largely out of the control of the application developer. Most APIs can respond quickly enough for responses to arrive back over the same connection. Application code can make a synchronous API call in a non-blocking way, giving the appearance of asynchronous processing, which is recommended for I/O-bound operations.</p><p>In some scenarios, however, the work done by backend may be long-running, on the order of seconds, or might be a background process that is executed in minutes or even hours. In that case, it isn't feasible to wait for the work to complete before responding to the request. This situation is a potential problem for any synchronous request-reply pattern.</p><p>Some architectures solve this problem by using a message broker to separate the request and response stages. This separation is often achieved by use of the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/queue-based-load-leveling" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Queue Based Load Leveling Pattern</a>.

<p>One solution to this problem is to use HTTP polling. Polling is useful to client-side code, as it can be hard to provide call-back endpoints or use long running connections.

<ul><li><p>There are a number of possible ways to implement this pattern over HTTP and not all upstream services have the same semantics.

<p>An application may initially be targeted at a desktop web UI. Typically, a backend service is developed in parallel that provides the features needed for that UI.

The backend service becomes a general-purpose backend, serving the requirements of both the desktop and mobile interfaces.</p><p>But the capabilities of a mobile device differ significantly from a desktop browser, in terms of screen size, performance, and display limitations. As a result, the requirements for a mobile application backend differ from the desktop web UI.</p><p>These differences result in competing requirements for the backend. The backend requires regular and significant changes to serve both the desktop web UI and the mobile application. Often, separate interface teams work on each frontend, causing the backend to become a bottleneck in the development process.

<p>The Bulkhead pattern is a type of application design that is tolerant of failure. In a bulkhead architecture, elements of an application are isolated into pools so that if one fails, the others will continue to function. It's named after the sectioned partitions (bulkheads) of a ship's hull. If the hull of a ship is compromised, only the damaged section fills with water, which prevents the ship from sinking.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>A cloud-based application may include multiple services, with each service having one or more consumers. Excessive load or failure in a service will impact all consumers of the service.</p><p>Moreover, a consumer may send requests to multiple services simultaneously, using resources for each request. When the consumer sends a request to a service that is misconfigured or not responding, the resources used by the client's request may not be freed in a timely manner. As requests to the service continue, those resources may be exhausted. For example, the client's connection pool may be exhausted. At that point, requests by the consumer to other services are affected. Eventually the consumer can no longer send requests to other services, not just the original unresponsive service.</p><p>The same issue of resource exhaustion affects services with multiple consumers. A large number of requests originating from one client may exhaust available resources in the service. Other consumers are no longer able to consume the service, causing a cascading failure effect.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Partition service instances into different groups, based on consumer load and availability requirements. This design helps to isolate failures, and allows you to sustain service functionality for some consumers, even during a failure.</p><p>A consumer can also partition resources, to ensure that resources used to call one service don't affect the resources used to call another service. For example, a consumer that calls multiple services may be assigned a connection pool for each service. If a service begins to fail, it only affects the connection pool assigned for that service, allowing the consumer to continue using the other services.</p><p>The benefits of this pattern include:</p><ul><li>Isolates consumers and services from cascading failures. An issue affecting a consumer or service can be isolated within its own bulkhead, preventing the entire solution from failing.</li><li>Allows you to preserve some functionality in the event of a service failure. Other services and features of the application will continue to work.</li><li>Allows you to deploy services that offer a different quality of service for consuming applications. A high-priority consumer pool can be configured to use high-priority services.</li></ul><p>The following diagram shows bulkheads structured around connection pools that call individual services. If Service A fails or causes some other issue, the connection pool is isolated, so only workloads using the thread pool assigned to Service A are affected. Workloads that use Service B and C are not affected and can continue working without interruption.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533301/463533299.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533301/463533299.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533299" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="bulkhead-1.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533301" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>The next diagram shows multiple clients calling a single service.

<p>Applications use a cache to improve repeated access to information held in a data store. However, it's impractical to expect that cached data will always be completely consistent with the data in the data store.

</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><p><strong>Lifetime of cached data</strong>. Many caches implement an expiration policy that invalidates data and removes it from the cache if it's not accessed for a specified period. For cache-aside to be effective, ensure that the expiration policy matches the pattern of access for applications that use the data. Don't make the expiration period too short because this can cause applications to continually retrieve data from the data store and add it to the cache. Similarly, don't make the expiration period so long that the cached data is likely to become stale. Remember that caching is most effective for relatively static data, or data that is read frequently.</p><p><strong>Evicting data</strong>. Most caches have a limited size compared to the data store where the data originates, and they'll evict data if necessary. Most caches adopt a least-recently-used policy for selecting items to evict, but this might be customizable. Configure the global expiration property and other properties of the cache, and the expiration property of each cached item, to ensure that the cache is cost effective. It isn't always appropriate to apply a global eviction policy to every item in the cache. For example, if a cached item is very expensive to retrieve from the data store, it can be beneficial to keep this item in the cache at the expense of more frequently accessed but less costly items.</p><p><strong>Priming the cache</strong>. Many solutions prepopulate the cache with the data that an application is likely to need as part of the startup processing. The Cache-Aside pattern can still be useful if some of this data expires or is evicted.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong>. Implementing the Cache-Aside pattern doesn't guarantee consistency between the data store and the cache. An item in the data store can be changed at any time by an external process, and this change might not be reflected in the cache until the next time the item is loaded. In a system that replicates data across data stores, this problem can become serious if synchronization occurs frequently.</p><p><strong>Local (in-memory) caching</strong>. A cache could be local to an application instance and stored in-memory. Cache-aside can be useful in this environment if an application repeatedly accesses the same data. However, a local cache is private and so different application instances could each have a copy of the same cached data. This data could quickly become inconsistent between caches, so it might be necessary to expire data held in a private cache and refresh it more frequently. In these scenarios, consider investigating the use of a shared or a distributed caching mechanism.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>When to use this Pattern</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Use this pattern when:</p><ul><li>A cache doesn't provide native read-through and write-through operations.</li><li>Resource demand is unpredictable. This pattern enables applications to load data on demand. It makes no assumptions about which data an application will require in advance.</li></ul><p>This pattern might not be suitable:</p><ul><li>When the cached data set is static.

<p>Have each component of the system participate in the decision-making process about the workflow of a business transaction, instead of relying on a central point of control.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>In microservices architecture, it’s often the case that a cloud-based application is divided into several small services that work together to process a business transaction end-to-end. To lower coupling between services, each service is responsible for a single business operation. Some benefits include faster development, smaller code base, and scalability. However, designing an efficient and scalable workflow is a challenge and often requires complex interservice communication.</p><p>The services communicate with each other by using well-defined APIs. Even a single business operation can result in multiple point-to-point calls amongst all services. A common pattern for communication is to use a centralized service that acts as the orchestrator. It acknowledges all incoming requests and delegates operations to the respective services. In doing so, it also manages the workflow of the entire business transaction. Each service just completes an operation and is not aware of the overall workflow.</p><p>The orchestrator pattern reduces point-to-point communication between services but has some drawbacks because of the tight coupling between the orchestrator and other services that participate in processing of the business transaction. To execute tasks in a sequence, the orchestrator needs to have some domain knowledge about the responsibilities of those services. If you want to add or remove services, existing logic will break, and you'll need to rewire portions of the communication path. While you can configure the workflow, add or remove services easily with a well-designed orchestrator, such an implementation is complex hard to maintain.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533308/463533306.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533308/463533306.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533306" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="orchestrator.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533308" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p><br/></p>

<p>Let each service decide when and how a business operation is processed, instead of depending on a central orchestrator.</p><p>One way to implement choreography is to use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/publisher-subscriber" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">asynchronous messaging pattern</a> to coordinate the business operations.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533308/463533307.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533308/463533307.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533307" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="choreography-pattern.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533308" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>A client request publishes messages to a message queue. As messages arrive, they are pushed to subscribers, or services, interested in that message. Each subscribed service does their operation as indicated by the message and responds to the message queue with success or failure of the operation. In case of success, the service can push a message back to the same queue or a different message queue so that another service can continue the workflow if needed. If an operation fails, the message bus can retry that operation.</p><p>This way, the services choreograph the workflow among themselves without depending on an orchestrator or having direct communication between them.</p><p>Because there isn't point-to-point communication, this pattern helps reduce coupling between services.

<p>Decentralizing the orchestrator can cause issues while managing the workflow.</p><p>If a service fails to complete a business operation, it can be difficult to recover from that failure. One way is to have the service indicate failure by firing an event. Another service subscribes to those failed events takes necessary actions such as applying <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">compensating transactions</a> to undo successful operations in a request. The failed service might also fail to fire an event for the failure. In that case, consider using a retry and, or time out mechanism to recognize that operation as a failure. For an example, see the Example section.</p><p>It's simple to implement a workflow when you want to process independent business operations in parallel. You can use a single message bus. However, the workflow can become complicated when choreography needs to occur in a sequence. For instance, Service C can start its operation only after Service A and Service B have completed their operations with success. One approach is to have multiple message buses that get messages in the required order. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/choreography#example" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Example</a> section.</p><p>The choreography pattern becomes a challenge if the number of services grow rapidly. Given the high number of independent moving parts, the workflow between services tends to get complex. Also, distributed tracing becomes difficult.</p><p>The orchestrator centrally manages the resiliency of the workflow and it can become a single point of failure. On the other hand, for choreography, the role is distributed between all services and resiliency becomes less robust.</p><p>Each service isn't only responsible for the resiliency of its operation but also the workflow. This responsibility can be burdensome for the service and hard to implement. Each service must retry transient, non-transient, and time-out failures, so that the request terminates gracefully, if needed. Also, the service must be diligent about communicating the success or failure of the operation so that other services can act accordingly.</p>

<p>Handle faults that might take a variable amount of time to recover from, when connecting to a remote service or resource. This can improve the stability and resiliency of an application.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>In a distributed environment, calls to remote resources and services can fail due to transient faults, such as slow network connections, timeouts, or the resources being overcommitted or temporarily unavailable. These faults typically correct themselves after a short period of time, and a robust cloud application should be prepared to handle them by using a strategy such as the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/retry" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Retry pattern</a>.</p><p>However, there can also be situations where faults are due to unanticipated events, and that might take much longer to fix. These faults can range in severity from a partial loss of connectivity to the complete failure of a service. In these situations it might be pointless for an application to continually retry an operation that is unlikely to succeed, and instead the application should quickly accept that the operation has failed and handle this failure accordingly.</p><p>Additionally, if a service is very busy, failure in one part of the system might lead to cascading failures. For example, an operation that invokes a service could be configured to implement a timeout, and reply with a failure message if the service fails to respond within this period. However, this strategy could cause many concurrent requests to the same operation to be blocked until the timeout period expires. These blocked requests might hold critical system resources such as memory, threads, database connections, and so on. Consequently, these resources could become exhausted, causing failure of other possibly unrelated parts of the system that need to use the same resources. In these situations, it would be preferable for the operation to fail immediately, and only attempt to invoke the service if it's likely to succeed. Note that setting a shorter timeout might help to resolve this problem, but the timeout shouldn't be so short that the operation fails most of the time, even if the request to the service would eventually succeed.</p>

<p>The Circuit Breaker pattern, popularized by Michael Nygard in his book, <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Release It!</a>, can prevent an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that's likely to fail. Allowing it to continue without waiting for the fault to be fixed or wasting CPU cycles while it determines that the fault is long lasting. The Circuit Breaker pattern also enables an application to detect whether the fault has been resolved. If the problem appears to have been fixed, the application can try to invoke the operation.</p><blockquote><p>The purpose of the Circuit Breaker pattern is different than the Retry pattern. The Retry pattern enables an application to retry an operation in the expectation that it'll succeed. The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents an application from performing an operation that is likely to fail. An application can combine these two patterns by using the Retry pattern to invoke an operation through a circuit breaker. However, the retry logic should be sensitive to any exceptions returned by the circuit breaker and abandon retry attempts if the circuit breaker indicates that a fault is not transient.</p></blockquote><p>A circuit breaker acts as a proxy for operations that might fail. The proxy should monitor the number of recent failures that have occurred, and use this information to decide whether to allow the operation to proceed, or simply return an exception immediately.</p><p>The proxy can be implemented as a state machine with the following states that mimic the functionality of an electrical circuit breaker:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Closed</strong>: The request from the application is routed to the operation. The proxy maintains a count of the number of recent failures, and if the call to the operation is unsuccessful the proxy increments this count. If the number of recent failures exceeds a specified threshold within a given time period, the proxy is placed into the <strong>Open</strong> state. At this point the proxy starts a timeout timer, and when this timer expires the proxy is placed into the <strong>Half-Open</strong> state.</p><blockquote><p>The purpose of the timeout timer is to give the system time to fix the problem that caused the failure before allowing the application to try to perform the operation again.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Open</strong>: The request from the application fails immediately and an exception is returned to the application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Half-Open</strong>: A limited number of requests from the application are allowed to pass through and invoke the operation. If these requests are successful, it's assumed that the fault that was previously causing the failure has been fixed and the circuit breaker switches to the <strong>Closed</strong> state (the failure counter is reset). If any request fails, the circuit breaker assumes that the fault is still present so it reverts back to the <strong>Open</strong> state and restarts the timeout timer to give the system a further period of time to recover from the failure.</p><blockquote><p>The<strong>Half-Open</strong>state is useful to prevent a recovering service from suddenly being flooded with requests. As a service recovers, it might be able to support a limited volume of requests until the recovery is complete, but while recovery is in progress a flood of work can cause the service to time out or fail again.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533311/463533310.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533311/463533310.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533310" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="circuit-breaker-diagram.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533311" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>In the figure, the failure counter used by the <strong>Closed</strong> state is time based. It's automatically reset at periodic intervals. This helps to prevent the circuit breaker from entering the <strong>Open</strong> state if it experiences occasional failures. The failure threshold that trips the circuit breaker into the <strong>Open</strong> state is only reached when a specified number of failures have occurred during a specified interval. The counter used by the <strong>Half-Open</strong> state records the number of successful attempts to invoke the operation. The circuit breaker reverts to the <strong>Closed</strong> state after a specified number of consecutive operation invocations have been successful. If any invocation fails, the circuit breaker enters the <strong>Open</strong> state immediately and the success counter will be reset the next time it enters the <strong>Half-Open</strong> state.</p><blockquote><p>How the system recovers is handled externally, possibly by restoring or restarting a failed component or repairing a network connection.</p></blockquote><p>The Circuit Breaker pattern provides stability while the system recovers from a failure and minimizes the impact on performance. It can help to maintain the response time of the system by quickly rejecting a request for an operation that's likely to fail, rather than waiting for the operation to time out, or never return. If the circuit breaker raises an event each time it changes state, this information can be used to monitor the health of the part of the system protected by the circuit breaker, or to alert an administrator when a circuit breaker trips to the <strong>Open</strong> state.</p><p>The pattern is customizable and can be adapted according to the type of the possible failure. For example, you can apply an increasing timeout timer to a circuit breaker. You could place the circuit breaker in the <strong>Open</strong> state for a few seconds initially, and then if the failure hasn't been resolved increase the timeout to a few minutes, and so on. In some cases, rather than the <strong>Open</strong> state returning failure and raising an exception, it could be useful to return a default value that is meaningful to the application.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>You should consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><p><strong>Exception Handling</strong>. An application invoking an operation through a circuit breaker must be prepared to handle the exceptions raised if the operation is unavailable. The way exceptions are handled will be application specific. For example, an application could temporarily degrade its functionality, invoke an alternative operation to try to perform the same task or obtain the same data, or report the exception to the user and ask them to try again later.</p><p><strong>Types of Exceptions</strong>. A request might fail for many reasons, some of which might indicate a more severe type of failure than others. For example, a request might fail because a remote service has crashed and will take several minutes to recover, or because of a timeout due to the service being temporarily overloaded. A circuit breaker might be able to examine the types of exceptions that occur and adjust its strategy depending on the nature of these exceptions. For example, it might require a larger number of timeout exceptions to trip the circuit breaker to the <strong>Open</strong> state compared to the number of failures due to the service being completely unavailable.</p><p><strong>Logging</strong>. A circuit breaker should log all failed requests (and possibly successful requests) to enable an administrator to monitor the health of the operation.</p><p><strong>Recoverability</strong>. You should configure the circuit breaker to match the likely recovery pattern of the operation it's protecting. For example, if the circuit breaker remains in the <strong>Open</strong> state for a long period, it could raise exceptions even if the reason for the failure has been resolved. Similarly, a circuit breaker could fluctuate and reduce the response times of applications if it switches from the <strong>Open</strong> state to the <strong>Half-Open</strong> state too quickly.</p><p><strong>Testing Failed Operations</strong>. In the <strong>Open</strong> state, rather than using a timer to determine when to switch to the <strong>Half-Open</strong> state, a circuit breaker can instead periodically ping the remote service or resource to determine whether it's become available again. This ping could take the form of an attempt to invoke an operation that had previously failed, or it could use a special operation provided by the remote service specifically for testing the health of the service, as described by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/health-endpoint-monitoring" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Health Endpoint Monitoring pattern</a>.</p><p><strong>Manual Override</strong>. In a system where the recovery time for a failing operation is extremely variable, it's beneficial to provide a manual reset option that enables an administrator to close a circuit breaker (and reset the failure counter). Similarly, an administrator could force a circuit breaker into the <strong>Open</strong> state (and restart the timeout timer) if the operation protected by the circuit breaker is temporarily unavailable.</p><p><strong>Concurrency</strong>. The same circuit breaker could be accessed by a large number of concurrent instances of an application. The implementation shouldn't block concurrent requests or add excessive overhead to each call to an operation.</p><p><strong>Resource Differentiation</strong>. Be careful when using a single circuit breaker for one type of resource if there might be multiple underlying independent providers. For example, in a data store that contains multiple shards, one shard might be fully accessible while another is experiencing a temporary issue. If the error responses in these scenarios are merged, an application might try to access some shards even when failure is highly likely, while access to other shards might be blocked even though it's likely to succeed.</p><p><strong>Accelerated Circuit Breaking</strong>. Sometimes a failure response can contain enough information for the circuit breaker to trip immediately and stay tripped for a minimum amount of time. For example, the error response from a shared resource that's overloaded could indicate that an immediate retry isn't recommended and that the application should instead try again in a few minutes.</p><blockquote><p>A service can return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) if it is throttling the client, or HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) if the service is not currently available. The response can include additional information, such as the anticipated duration of the delay.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Replaying Failed Requests</strong>. In the <strong>Open</strong> state, rather than simply failing quickly, a circuit breaker could also record the details of each request to a journal and arrange for these requests to be replayed when the remote resource or service becomes available.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Timeouts on External Services</strong>. A circuit breaker might not be able to fully protect applications from operations that fail in external services that are configured with a lengthy timeout period. If the timeout is too long, a thread running a circuit breaker might be blocked for an extended period before the circuit breaker indicates that the operation has failed. In this time, many other application instances might also try to invoke the service through the circuit breaker and tie up a significant number of threads before they all fail.</p>

<p>In traditional architectures, the same data model is used to query and update a database. That's simple and works well for basic CRUD operations. In more complex applications, however, this approach can become unwieldy.

In a CQRS context, one benefit of Event Sourcing is that the same events can be used to notify other components — in particular, to notify the read model.

<p>Applications running in the cloud frequently modify data. This data might be spread across various data sources held in different geographic locations. To avoid contention and improve performance in a distributed environment, an application shouldn't try to provide strong transactional consistency. Rather, the application should implement eventual consistency. In this model, a typical business operation consists of a series of separate steps. While these steps are being performed, the overall view of the system state might be inconsistent, but when the operation has completed and all of the steps have been executed the system should become consistent again.</p><blockquote><p>The <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn589800.aspx" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Data Consistency Primer</a> provides information about why distributed transactions don't scale well, and the principles of the eventual consistency model.</p></blockquote><p>A challenge in the eventual consistency model is how to handle a step that has failed. In this case it might be necessary to undo all of the work completed by the previous steps in the operation. However, the data can't simply be rolled back because other concurrent instances of the application might have changed it. Even in cases where the data hasn't been changed by a concurrent instance, undoing a step might not simply be a matter of restoring the original state. It might be necessary to apply various business-specific rules (see the travel website described in the Example section).</p><p>If an operation that implements eventual consistency spans several heterogeneous data stores, undoing the steps in the operation will require visiting each data store in turn. The work performed in every data store must be undone reliably to prevent the system from remaining inconsistent.</p><p>Not all data affected by an operation that implements eventual consistency might be held in a database. In a service oriented architecture (SOA) environment an operation could invoke an action in a service, and cause a change in the state held by that service. To undo the operation, this state change must also be undone. This can involve invoking the service again and performing another action that reverses the effects of the first.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>The solution is to implement a compensating transaction. The steps in a compensating transaction must undo the effects of the steps in the original operation. A compensating transaction might not be able to simply replace the current state with the state the system was in at the start of the operation because this approach could overwrite changes made by other concurrent instances of an application. Instead, it must be an intelligent process that takes into account any work done by concurrent instances. This process will usually be application specific, driven by the nature of the work performed by the original operation.</p><p>A common approach is to use a workflow to implement an eventually consistent operation that requires compensation. As the original operation proceeds, the system records information about each step and how the work performed by that step can be undone. If the operation fails at any point, the workflow rewinds back through the steps it's completed and performs the work that reverses each step. Note that a compensating transaction might not have to undo the work in the exact reverse order of the original operation, and it might be possible to perform some of the undo steps in parallel.</p><blockquote><p>This approach is similar to the Sagas strategy discussed in <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://vasters.com/clemensv/2012/09/01/Sagas.aspx" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Clemens Vasters’ blog</a>.</p></blockquote><p>A compensating transaction is also an eventually consistent operation and it could also fail. The system should be able to resume the compensating transaction at the point of failure and continue. It might be necessary to repeat a step that's failed, so the steps in a compensating transaction should be defined as idempotent commands. For more information, see <a href="https://blog.jonathanoliver.com/idempotency-patterns/" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Idempotency Patterns</a> on Jonathan Oliver’s blog.</p><p>In some cases it might not be possible to recover from a step that has failed except through manual intervention.

<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><p>It might not be easy to determine when a step in an operation that implements eventual consistency has failed. A step might not fail immediately, but instead could block. It might be necessary to implement some form of time-out mechanism.</p><p>-Compensation logic isn't easily generalized. A compensating transaction is application specific. It relies on the application having sufficient information to be able to undo the effects of each step in a failed operation.</p><p>You should define the steps in a compensating transaction as idempotent commands. This enables the steps to be repeated if the compensating transaction itself fails.</p><p>The infrastructure that handles the steps in the original operation, and the compensating transaction, must be resilient. It must not lose the information required to compensate for a failing step, and it must be able to reliably monitor the progress of the compensation logic.</p><p>A compensating transaction doesn't necessarily return the data in the system to the state it was in at the start of the original operation. Instead, it compensates for the work performed by the steps that completed successfully before the operation failed.</p><p>The order of the steps in the compensating transaction doesn't necessarily have to be the exact opposite of the steps in the original operation. For example, one data store might be more sensitive to inconsistencies than another, and so the steps in the compensating transaction that undo the changes to this store should occur first.</p><p>Placing a short-term timeout-based lock on each resource that's required to complete an operation, and obtaining these resources in advance, can help increase the likelihood that the overall activity will succeed. The work should be performed only after all the resources have been acquired. All actions must be finalized before the locks expire.</p><p>Consider using retry logic that is more forgiving than usual to minimize failures that trigger a compensating transaction.

<p>An application running in the cloud is expected to handle a large number of requests. Rather than process each request synchronously, a common technique is for the application to pass them through a messaging system to another service (a consumer service) that handles them asynchronously. This strategy helps to ensure that the business logic in the application isn't blocked while the requests are being processed.</p><p>The number of requests can vary significantly over time for many reasons. A sudden increase in user activity or aggregated requests coming from multiple tenants can cause an unpredictable workload. At peak hours a system might need to process many hundreds of requests per second, while at other times the number could be very small. Additionally, the nature of the work performed to handle these requests might be highly variable. Using a single instance of the consumer service can cause that instance to become flooded with requests, or the messaging system might be overloaded by an influx of messages coming from the application. To handle this fluctuating workload, the system can run multiple instances of the consumer service. However, these consumers must be coordinated to ensure that each message is only delivered to a single consumer. The workload also needs to be load balanced across consumers to prevent an instance from becoming a bottleneck.</p>

<p>Use a message queue to implement the communication channel between the application and the instances of the consumer service. The application posts requests in the form of messages to the queue, and the consumer service instances receive messages from the queue and process them. This approach enables the same pool of consumer service instances to handle messages from any instance of the application. The figure illustrates using a message queue to distribute work to instances of a service.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533328/463533327.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533328/463533327.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533327" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="competing-consumers-diagram.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533328" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>This solution has the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>It provides a load-leveled system that can handle wide variations in the volume of requests sent by application instances.

If a producer communicates directly with a consumer instead of using this pattern, but doesn't monitor the consumer, there's a high probability that messages could be lost or fail to be processed if the consumer fails.

A failed service instance won't block a producer, and messages can be processed by any working service instance.</p></li><li><p>It doesn't require complex coordination between the consumers, or between the producer and the consumer instances.

The service instance handling a message is fully decoupled from the application logic that generates the message, and they might not be able to communicate directly. If the service instance generates results that must be passed back to the application logic, this information must be stored in a location that's accessible to both. In order to prevent the application logic from retrieving incomplete data the system must indicate when processing is complete.</p><blockquote><p>If you're using Azure, a worker process can pass results back to the application logic by using a dedicated message reply queue.

These items run in their own virtual environment. Running a collection of separate roles, websites, or virtual machines that are designed to perform a set of well-defined operations, but that need to communicate and cooperate as part of a single solution, can be an inefficient use of resources.</p>

<p>To help reduce costs, increase utilization, improve communication speed, and reduce management it's possible to consolidate multiple tasks or operations into a single computational unit.</p><p>Tasks can be grouped according to criteria based on the features provided by the environment and the costs associated with these features. A common approach is to look for tasks that have a similar profile concerning their scalability, lifetime, and processing requirements. Grouping these together allows them to scale as a unit. The elasticity provided by many cloud environments enables additional instances of a computational unit to be started and stopped according to the workload. For example, Azure provides autoscaling that you can apply to roles in a Cloud Service, App Services, and Virtual Machines. For more information, see <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn589774.aspx" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Autoscaling Guidance</a>.</p><p>As a counter example to show how scalability can be used to determine which operations shouldn't be grouped together, consider the following two tasks:</p><ul><li>Task 1 polls for infrequent, time-insensitive messages sent to a queue.</li><li>Task 2 handles high-volume bursts of network traffic.</li></ul><p>The second task requires elasticity that can involve starting and stopping a large number of instances of the computational unit. Applying the same scaling to the first task would simply result in more tasks listening for infrequent messages on the same queue, and is a waste of resources.</p><p>In many cloud environments it's possible to specify the resources available to a computational unit in terms of the number of CPU cores, memory, disk space, and so on. Generally, the more resources specified, the greater the cost. To save money, it's important to maximize the work an expensive computational unit performs, and not let it become inactive for an extended period.</p><p>If there are tasks that require a great deal of CPU power in short bursts, consider consolidating these into a single computational unit that provides the necessary power. However, it's important to balance this need to keep expensive resources busy against the contention that could occur if they are over stressed. Long-running, compute-intensive tasks shouldn't share the same computational unit, for example.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Consider the following points when implementing this pattern:</p><p><strong>Scalability and elasticity</strong>. Many cloud solutions implement scalability and elasticity at the level of the computational unit by starting and stopping instances of units. Avoid grouping tasks that have conflicting scalability requirements in the same computational unit.</p><p><strong>Lifetime</strong>. The cloud infrastructure periodically recycles the virtual environment that hosts a computational unit. When there are many long-running tasks inside a computational unit, it might be necessary to configure the unit to prevent it from being recycled until these tasks have finished. Alternatively, design the tasks by using a check-pointing approach that enables them to stop cleanly, and continue at the point they were interrupted when the computational unit is restarted.</p><p><strong>Release cadence</strong>. If the implementation or configuration of a task changes frequently, it might be necessary to stop the computational unit hosting the updated code, reconfigure and redeploy the unit, and then restart it. This process will also require that all other tasks within the same computational unit are stopped, redeployed, and restarted.</p><p><strong>Security</strong>. Tasks in the same computational unit might share the same security context and be able to access the same resources. There must be a high degree of trust between the tasks, and confidence that one task isn't going to corrupt or adversely affect another. Additionally, increasing the number of tasks running in a computational unit increases the attack surface of the unit. Each task is only as secure as the one with the most vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>Fault tolerance</strong>. If one task in a computational unit fails or behaves abnormally, it can affect the other tasks running within the same unit. For example, if one task fails to start correctly it can cause the entire startup logic for the computational unit to fail, and prevent other tasks in the same unit from running.</p><p><strong>Contention</strong>. Avoid introducing contention between tasks that compete for resources in the same computational unit. Ideally, tasks that share the same computational unit should exhibit different resource utilization characteristics. For example, two compute-intensive tasks should probably not reside in the same computational unit, and neither should two tasks that consume large amounts of memory. However, mixing a compute-intensive task with a task that requires a large amount of memory is a workable combination.</p><blockquote><p>Consider consolidating compute resources only for a system that's been in production for a period of time so that operators and developers can monitor the system and create a <em>heat map</em> that identifies how each task uses differing resources. This map can be used to determine which tasks are good candidates for sharing compute resources.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Complexity</strong>. Combining multiple tasks into a single computational unit adds complexity to the code in the unit, possibly making it more difficult to test, debug, and maintain.</p><p><strong>Stable logical architecture</strong>. Design and implement the code in each task so that it shouldn't need to change, even if the physical environment the task runs in does change.</p><p><strong>Other strategies</strong>. Consolidating compute resources is only one way to help reduce costs associated with running multiple tasks concurrently. It requires careful planning and monitoring to ensure that it remains an effective approach. Other strategies might be more appropriate, depending on the nature of the work and where the users these tasks are running are located. For example, functional decomposition of the workload (as described by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn589773.aspx" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Compute Partitioning Guidance</a>) might be a better option.</p>

<p>Use this pattern for tasks that are not cost effective if they run in their own computational units. If a task spends much of its time idle, running this task in a dedicated unit can be expensive.</p><p>This pattern might not be suitable for tasks that perform critical fault-tolerant operations, or tasks that process highly sensitive or private data and require their own security context.

<p>The Event Sourcing pattern defines an approach to handling operations on data that's driven by a sequence of events, each of which is recorded in an append-only store. Application code sends a series of events that imperatively describe each action that has occurred on the data to the event store, where they're persisted. Each event represents a set of changes to the data (such as <code>AddedItemToOrder</code>).</p><p>The events are persisted in an event store that acts as the system of record (the authoritative data source) about the current state of the data. The event store typically publishes these events so that consumers can be notified and can handle them if needed. Consumers could, for example, initiate tasks that apply the operations in the events to other systems, or perform any other associated action that's required to complete the operation. Notice that the application code that generates the events is decoupled from the systems that subscribe to the events.</p><p>Typical uses of the events published by the event store are to maintain materialized views of entities as actions in the application change them, and for integration with external systems. For example, a system can maintain a materialized view of all customer orders that's used to populate parts of the UI. As the application adds new orders, adds or removes items on the order, and adds shipping information, the events that describe these changes can be handled and used to update the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/materialized-view" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">materialized view</a>.</p><p>In addition, at any point it's possible for applications to read the history of events, and use it to materialize the current state of an entity by playing back and consuming all the events related to that entity. This can occur on demand to materialize a domain object when handling a request, or through a scheduled task so that the state of the entity can be stored as a materialized view to support the presentation layer.</p><p>The figure shows an overview of the pattern, including some of the options for using the event stream such as creating a materialized view, integrating events with external applications and systems, and replaying events to create projections of the current state of specific entities.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533332/463533331.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533332/463533331.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533331" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="event-sourcing-overview.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533332" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>The Event Sourcing pattern provides the following advantages:</p><ul><li><p>Events are immutable and can be stored using an append-only operation. The user interface, workflow, or process that initiated an event can continue, and tasks that handle the events can run in the background. This, combined with the fact that there's no contention during the processing of transactions, can vastly improve performance and scalability for applications, especially for the presentation level or user interface.</p></li><li><p>Events are simple objects that describe some action that occurred, together with any associated data required to describe the action represented by the event. Events don't directly update a data store. They're simply recorded for handling at the appropriate time. This can simplify implementation and management.</p></li><li><p>Events typically have meaning for a domain expert, whereas <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">object-relational impedance mismatch</a> can make complex database tables hard to understand. Tables are artificial constructs that represent the current state of the system, not the events that occurred.</p></li><li><p>Event sourcing can help prevent concurrent updates from causing conflicts because it avoids the requirement to directly update objects in the data store. However, the domain model must still be designed to protect itself from requests that might result in an inconsistent state.</p></li><li><p>The append-only storage of events provides an audit trail that can be used to monitor actions taken against a data store, regenerate the current state as materialized views or projections by replaying the events at any time, and assist in testing and debugging the system. In addition, the requirement to use compensating events to cancel changes provides a history of changes that were reversed, which wouldn't be the case if the model simply stored the current state. The list of events can also be used to analyze application performance and detect user behavior trends, or to obtain other useful business information.</p></li><li><p>The event store raises events, and tasks perform operations in response to those events. This decoupling of the tasks from the events provides flexibility and extensibility. Tasks know about the type of event and the event data, but not about the operation that triggered the event. In addition, multiple tasks can handle each event. This enables easy integration with other services and systems that only listen for new events raised by the event store. However, the event sourcing events tend to be very low level, and it might be necessary to generate specific integration events instead.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Event sourcing is commonly combined with the CQRS pattern by performing the data management tasks in response to the events, and by materializing views from the stored events.</p></blockquote>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><p>The system will only be eventually consistent when creating materialized views or generating projections of data by replaying events. There's some delay between an application adding events to the event store as the result of handling a request, the events being published, and consumers of the events handling them. During this period, new events that describe further changes to entities might have arrived at the event store.</p><blockquote><p>See the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn589800.aspx" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Data Consistency Primer</a> for information about eventual consistency.</p></blockquote><p>The event store is the permanent source of information, and so the event data should never be updated. The only way to update an entity to undo a change is to add a compensating event to the event store. If the format (rather than the data) of the persisted events needs to change, perhaps during a migration, it can be difficult to combine existing events in the store with the new version. It might be necessary to iterate through all the events making changes so they're compliant with the new format, or add new events that use the new format. Consider using a version stamp on each version of the event schema to maintain both the old and the new event formats.</p><p>Multi-threaded applications and multiple instances of applications might be storing events in the event store. The consistency of events in the event store is vital, as is the order of events that affect a specific entity (the order that changes occur to an entity affects its current state). Adding a timestamp to every event can help to avoid issues. Another common practice is to annotate each event resulting from a request with an incremental identifier. If two actions attempt to add events for the same entity at the same time, the event store can reject an event that matches an existing entity identifier and event identifier.</p><p>There's no standard approach, or existing mechanisms such as SQL queries, for reading the events to obtain information. The only data that can be extracted is a stream of events using an event identifier as the criteria. The event ID typically maps to individual entities. The current state of an entity can be determined only by replaying all of the events that relate to it against the original state of that entity.</p><p>The length of each event stream affects managing and updating the system. If the streams are large, consider creating snapshots at specific intervals such as a specified number of events. The current state of the entity can be obtained from the snapshot and by replaying any events that occurred after that point in time. For more information about creating snapshots of data, see <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/Snapshot.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Snapshot on Martin Fowler’s Enterprise Application Architecture website</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff650012.aspx" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Master-Subordinate Snapshot Replication</a>.</p><p>Even though event sourcing minimizes the chance of conflicting updates to the data, the application must still be able to deal with inconsistencies that result from eventual consistency and the lack of transactions. For example, an event that indicates a reduction in stock inventory might arrive in the data store while an order for that item is being placed, resulting in a requirement to reconcile the two operations either by advising the customer or creating a back order.</p><p>Event publication might be &quot;at least once,&quot; and so consumers of the events must be idempotent. They must not reapply the update described in an event if the event is handled more than once. For example, if multiple instances of a consumer maintain an aggregate an entity's property, such as the total number of orders placed, only one must succeed in incrementing the aggregate when an order placed event occurs. While this isn't a key characteristic of event sourcing, it's the usual implementation decision.</p>

<p>Use this pattern in the following scenarios:</p><ul><li><p>When you want to capture intent, purpose, or reason in the data.

<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><p>Choose a backing store that offers acceptable performance, high availability, robustness, and can be backed up as part of the application maintenance and administration process. In a cloud-hosted application, using a cloud storage mechanism is usually a good choice to meet these requirements.</p><p>Design the schema of the backing store to allow flexibility in the types of information it can hold. Ensure that it provides for all configuration requirements such as typed data, collections of settings, multiple versions of settings, and any other features that the applications using it require. The schema should be easy to extend to support additional settings as requirements change.</p><p>Consider the physical capabilities of the backing store, how it relates to the way configuration information is stored, and the effects on performance. For example, storing an XML document containing configuration information will require either the configuration interface or the application to parse the document in order to read individual settings. It'll make updating a setting more complicated, though caching the settings can help to offset slower read performance.</p><p>Consider how the configuration interface will permit control of the scope and inheritance of configuration settings. For example, it might be a requirement to scope configuration settings at the organization, application, and the machine level. It might need to support delegation of control over access to different scopes, and to prevent or allow individual applications to override settings.</p><p>Ensure that the configuration interface can expose the configuration data in the required formats such as typed values, collections, key/value pairs, or property bags.</p><p>Consider how the configuration store interface will behave when settings contain errors, or don't exist in the backing store. It might be appropriate to return default settings and log errors. Also consider aspects such as the case sensitivity of configuration setting keys or names, the storage and handling of binary data, and the ways that null or empty values are handled.</p><p>Consider how to protect the configuration data to allow access to only the appropriate users and applications. This is likely a feature of the configuration store interface, but it's also necessary to ensure that the data in the backing store can't be accessed directly without the appropriate permission. Ensure strict separation between the permissions required to read and to write configuration data. Also consider whether you need to encrypt some or all of the configuration settings, and how this'll be implemented in the configuration store interface.</p><p>Centrally stored configurations, which change application behavior during runtime, are critically important and should be deployed, updated, and managed using the same mechanisms as deploying application code. For example, changes that can affect more than one application must be carried out using a full test and staged deployment approach to ensure that the change is appropriate for all applications that use this configuration. If an administrator edits a setting to update one application, it could adversely impact other applications that use the same setting.</p><p>If an application caches configuration information, the application needs to be alerted if the configuration changes.

</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Users typically need to work with multiple applications provided and hosted by different organizations they have a business relationship with. These users might be required to use specific (and different) credentials for each one. This can:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cause a disjointed user experience</strong>. Users often forget sign-in credentials when they have many different ones.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expose security vulnerabilities</strong>. When a user leaves the company the account must immediately be deprovisioned. It's easy to overlook this in large organizations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Complicate user management</strong>. Administrators must manage credentials for all of the users, and perform additional tasks such as providing password reminders.</p></li></ul><p>Users typically prefer to use the same credentials for all these applications.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Implement an authentication mechanism that can use federated identity. Separate user authentication from the application code, and delegate authentication to a trusted identity provider. This can simplify development and allow users to authenticate using a wider range of identity providers (IdP) while minimizing the administrative overhead. It also allows you to clearly decouple authentication from authorization.</p><p>The trusted identity providers include corporate directories, on-premises federation services, other security token services (STS) provided by business partners, or social identity providers that can authenticate users who have, for example, a Microsoft, Google, Yahoo!, or Facebook account.</p><p>The figure illustrates the Federated Identity pattern when a client application needs to access a service that requires authentication. The authentication is performed by an IdP that works in concert with an STS. The IdP issues security tokens that provide information about the authenticated user. This information, referred to as claims, includes the user’s identity, and might also include other information such as role membership and more granular access rights.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533336/463533335.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533336/463533335.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533335" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="federated-identity-overview.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533336" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>This model is often called claims-based access control. Applications and services authorize access to features and functionality based on the claims contained in the token. The service that requires authentication must trust the IdP. The client application contacts the IdP that performs the authentication. If the authentication is successful, the IdP returns a token containing the claims that identify the user to the STS (note that the IdP and STS can be the same service). The STS can transform and augment the claims in the token based on predefined rules, before returning it to the client. The client application can then pass this token to the service as proof of its identity.</p><blockquote><p>There might be additional STSs in the chain of trust. For example, in the scenario described later, an on-premises STS trusts another STS that is responsible for accessing an identity provider to authenticate the user. This approach is common in enterprise scenarios where there's an on-premises STS and directory.</p></blockquote><p>Federated authentication provides a standards-based solution to the issue of trusting identities across diverse domains, and can support single sign-on. It's becoming more common across all types of applications, especially cloud-hosted applications, because it supports single sign-on without requiring a direct network connection to identity providers. The user doesn't have to enter credentials for every application. This increases security because it prevents the creation of credentials required to access many different applications, and it also hides the user’s credentials from all but the original identity provider. Applications see just the authenticated identity information contained within the token.</p><p>Federated identity also has the major advantage that management of the identity and credentials is the responsibility of the identity provider. The application or service doesn't need to provide identity management features. In addition, in corporate scenarios, the corporate directory doesn't need to know about the user if it trusts the identity provider. This removes all the administrative overhead of managing the user identity within the directory.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Consider the following when designing applications that implement federated authentication:</p><ul><li><p>Authentication can be a single point of failure. If you deploy your application to multiple datacenters, consider deploying your identity management mechanism to the same datacenters to maintain application reliability and availability.</p></li><li><p>Authentication tools make it possible to configure access control based on role claims contained in the authentication token. This is often referred to as role-based access control (RBAC), and it can allow a more granular level of control over access to features and resources.</p></li><li><p>Unlike a corporate directory, claims-based authentication using social identity providers doesn't usually provide information about the authenticated user other than an email address, and perhaps a name. Some social identity providers, such as a Microsoft account, provide only a unique identifier. The application usually needs to maintain some information on registered users, and be able to match this information to the identifier contained in the claims in the token. Typically this is done through registration when the user first accesses the application, and information is then injected into the token as additional claims after each authentication.</p></li><li><p>If there's more than one identity provider configured for the STS, it must detect which identity provider the user should be redirected to for authentication. This process is called home realm discovery. The STS might be able to do this automatically based on an email address or user name that the user provides, a subdomain of the application that the user is accessing, the user’s IP address scope, or on the contents of a cookie stored in the user’s browser. For example, if the user entered an email address in the Microsoft domain, such as <a href="mailto:user@live.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">user@live.com</a>, the STS will redirect the user to the Microsoft account sign-in page. On later visits, the STS could use a cookie to indicate that the last sign in was with a Microsoft account. If automatic discovery can't determine the home realm, the STS will display a home realm discovery page that lists the trusted identity providers, and the user must select the one they want to use.</p></li></ul>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>When to use this Pattern</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>This pattern is useful for scenarios such as:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Single sign-on in the enterprise</strong>. In this scenario you need to authenticate employees for corporate applications that are hosted in the cloud outside the corporate security boundary, without requiring them to sign in every time they visit an application. The user experience is the same as when using on-premises applications where they're authenticated when signing in to a corporate network, and from then on have access to all relevant applications without needing to sign in again.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federated identity with multiple partners</strong>. In this scenario you need to authenticate both corporate employees and business partners who don't have accounts in the corporate directory. This is common in business-to-business applications, applications that integrate with third-party services, and where companies with different IT systems have merged or shared resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federated identity in SaaS applications</strong>. In this scenario independent software vendors provide a ready-to-use service for multiple clients or tenants. Each tenant authenticates using a suitable identity provider. For example, business users will use their corporate credentials, while consumers and clients of the tenant will use their social identity credentials.</p></li></ul><p>This pattern might not be useful in the following situations:</p><ul><li><p>All users of the application can be authenticated by one identity provider, and there's no requirement to authenticate using any other identity provider. This is typical in business applications that use a corporate directory (accessible within the application) for authentication, by using a VPN, or (in a cloud-hosted scenario) through a virtual network connection between the on-premises directory and the application.</p></li><li><p>The application was originally built using a different authentication mechanism, perhaps with custom user stores, or doesn't have the capability to handle the negotiation standards used by claims-based technologies. Retrofitting claims-based authentication and access control into existing applications can be complex, and probably not cost effective.</p></li></ul>

</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Applications expose their functionality to clients by accepting and processing requests.

This code performs authentication and validation, some or all request processing, and is likely to accesses storage and other services on behalf of the client.</p><p>If a malicious user is able to compromise the system and gain access to the application’s hosting environment, the security mechanisms it uses such as credentials and storage keys, and the services and data it accesses, are exposed.

</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>To minimize the risk of clients gaining access to sensitive information and services, decouple hosts or tasks that expose public endpoints from the code that processes requests and accesses storage. You can achieve this by using a façade or a dedicated task that interacts with clients and then hands off the request—perhaps through a decoupled interface—to the hosts or tasks that'll handle the request. The figure provides a high-level overview of this pattern.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533347/463533346.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533347/463533346.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533346" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="gatekeeper-diagram.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533347" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p><br/></p><p>The gatekeeper pattern can be used to simply protect storage, or it can be used as a more comprehensive façade to protect all of the functions of the application. The important factors are:</p><ul><li><strong>Controlled validation</strong>. The gatekeeper validates all requests, and rejects those that don't meet validation requirements.</li><li><strong>Limited risk and exposure</strong>. The gatekeeper doesn't have access to the credentials or keys used by the trusted host to access storage and services. If the gatekeeper is compromised, the attacker doesn't get access to these credentials or keys.</li><li><strong>Appropriate security</strong>. The gatekeeper runs in a limited privilege mode, while the rest of the application runs in the full trust mode required to access storage and services. If the gatekeeper is compromised, it can't directly access the application services or data.</li></ul><p>This pattern acts like a firewall in a typical network topography. It allows the gatekeeper to examine requests and make a decision about whether to pass the request on to the trusted host (sometimes called the keymaster) that performs the required tasks. This decision typically requires the gatekeeper to validate and sanitize the request content before passing it on to the trusted host.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><ul><li>Ensure that the trusted hosts the gatekeeper passes requests to expose only internal or protected endpoints, and connect only to the gatekeeper.

Typically this means running the gatekeeper and the trusted host in separate hosted services or virtual machines.</li><li>The gatekeeper shouldn't perform any processing related to the application or services, or access any data.

The trusted hosts might need to perform additional validation of requests, but the core validation should be performed by the gatekeeper.</li><li>Use a secure communication channel (HTTPS, SSL, or TLS) between the gatekeeper and the trusted hosts or tasks where this is possible.

<p>To perform a single task, a client may have to make multiple calls to various backend services. An application that relies on many services to perform a task must expend resources on each request. When any new feature or service is added to the application, additional requests are needed, further increasing resource requirements and network calls. This chattiness between a client and a backend can adversely impact the performance and scale of the application. Microservice architectures have made this problem more common, as applications built around many smaller services naturally have a higher amount of cross-service calls.</p><p>In the following diagram, the client sends requests to each service (1,2,3). Each service processes the request and sends the response back to the application (4,5,6). Over a cellular network with typically high latency, using individual requests in this manner is inefficient and could result in broken connectivity or incomplete requests. While each request may be done in parallel, the application must send, wait, and process data for each request, all on separate connections, increasing the chance of failure.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533350/463533348.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533350/463533348.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533348" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="gateway-aggregation-problem (1).png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533350" data-linked-resource-container-version="3"></p><p><br/></p>

<p>When a client needs to consume multiple services, setting up a separate endpoint for each service and having the client manage each endpoint can be challenging. For example, an e-commerce application might provide services such as search, reviews, cart, checkout, and order history. Each service has a different API that the client must interact with, and the client must know about each endpoint in order to connect to the services. If an API changes, the client must be updated as well. If you refactor a service into two or more separate services, the code must change in both the service and the client.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Place a gateway in front of a set of applications, services, or deployments. Use application Layer 7 routing to route the request to the appropriate instances.</p><p>With this pattern, the client application only needs to know about and communicate with a single endpoint. If a service is consolidated or decomposed, the client does not necessarily require updating. It can continue making requests to the gateway, and only the routing changes.</p><p>A gateway also lets you abstract backend services from the clients, allowing you to keep client calls simple while enabling changes in the backend services behind the gateway. Client calls can be routed to whatever service or services need to handle the expected client behavior, allowing you to add, split, and reorganize services behind the gateway without changing the client.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533354/463533353.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533354/463533353.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533353" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="gateway-routing.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533354" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>This pattern can also help with deployment, by allowing you to manage how updates are rolled out to users. When a new version of your service is deployed, it can be deployed in parallel with the existing version. Routing lets you control what version of the service is presented to the clients, giving you the flexibility to use various release strategies, whether incremental, parallel, or complete rollouts of updates. Any issues discovered after the new service is deployed can be quickly reverted by making a configuration change at the gateway, without affecting clients.</p>

Data replication services ensure that data stores are identical across geodes, so <em>all</em> requests can be served from <em>all</em> geodes.<br/></p><p>The key difference between a deployment stamp and a geode is that geodes never exist in isolation.

Geodes are not the same as clusters because they share a replication backplane, so the platform takes care of quorum issues.</li></ul><p>The geode pattern occurs in big data architectures that use commodity hardware to process data colocated on the same machine, and MapReduce to consolidate results across machines. Another usage is near-edge compute, which brings compute closer to the intelligent edge of the network to reduce response time.</p><p>Services can use this pattern over dozens or hundreds of geodes. Furthermore, the resiliency of the whole solution increases with each added geode, since any geodes can take over if a regional outage takes one or more geodes offline.</p><p>It's also possible to augment local availability techniques, such as availability zones or paired regions, with the geode pattern for global availability. This increases complexity, but is useful if your architecture is underpinned by a storage engine such as blob storage that can only replicate to a paired region.

For example, an HTTP response of 200 (OK) indicates that the application responded without error.

This can detect errors that affect only a section of the returned web page or service response.

</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><p>How to validate the response. For example, is just a single 200 (OK) status code sufficient to verify the application is working correctly? While this provides the most basic measure of application availability, and is the minimum implementation of this pattern, it provides little information about the operations, trends, and possible upcoming issues in the application.</p><blockquote><p>Make sure that the application correctly returns a 200 (OK) only when the target resource is found and processed. In some scenarios, such as when using a master page to host the target web page, the server sends back a 200 (OK) status code instead of a 404 (Not Found) code, even when the target content page was not found.</p></blockquote><p>The number of endpoints to expose for an application. One approach is to expose at least one endpoint for the core services that the application uses and another for lower priority services, allowing different levels of importance to be assigned to each monitoring result. Also consider exposing more endpoints, such as one for each core service, for additional monitoring granularity. For example, a health verification check might check the database, storage, and an external geocoding service that an application uses, with each requiring a different level of uptime and response time. The application could still be healthy if the geocoding service, or some other background task, is unavailable for a few minutes.</p><p>Whether to use the same endpoint for monitoring as is used for general access, but to a specific path designed for health verification checks, for example, /HealthCheck/{GUID}/ on the general access endpoint. This allows some functional tests in the application to be run by the monitoring tools, such as adding a new user registration, signing in, and placing a test order, while also verifying that the general access endpoint is available.</p><p>The type of information to collect in the service in response to monitoring requests, and how to return this information. Most existing tools and frameworks look only at the HTTP status code that the endpoint returns. To return and validate additional information, you might have to create a custom monitoring utility or service.</p><p>How much information to collect. Performing excessive processing during the check can overload the application and impact other users. The time it takes might exceed the timeout of the monitoring system so it marks the application as unavailable. Most applications include instrumentation such as error handlers and performance counters that log performance and detailed error information, this might be sufficient instead of returning additional information from a health verification check.</p><p>Caching the endpoint status. It could be expensive to run the health check too frequently. If the health status is reported through a dashboard, for example, you don't want every request from the dashboard to trigger a health check. Instead, periodically check the system health and cache the status. Expose an endpoint that returns the cached status.</p><p>How to configure security for the monitoring endpoints to protect them from public access, which might expose the application to malicious attacks, risk the exposure of sensitive information, or attract denial of service (DoS) attacks. Typically this should be done in the application configuration so that it can be updated easily without restarting the application. Consider using one or more of the following techniques:</p><ul><li><p>Secure the endpoint by requiring authentication. You can do this by using an authentication security key in the request header or by passing credentials with the request, provided that the monitoring service or tool supports authentication.</p><ul><li><p>Use an obscure or hidden endpoint. For example, expose the endpoint on a different IP address to that used by the default application URL, configure the endpoint on a nonstandard HTTP port, and/or use a complex path to the test page. You can usually specify additional endpoint addresses and ports in the application configuration, and add entries for these endpoints to the DNS server if required to avoid having to specify the IP address directly.</p></li><li><p>Expose a method on an endpoint that accepts a parameter such as a key value or an operation mode value. Depending on the value supplied for this parameter, when a request is received the code can perform a specific test or set of tests, or return a 404 (Not Found) error if the parameter value isn't recognized. The recognized parameter values could be set in the application configuration.</p><blockquote><p>DoS attacks are likely to have less impact on a separate endpoint that performs basic functional tests without compromising the operation of the application. Ideally, avoid using a test that might expose sensitive information. If you must return information that might be useful to an attacker, consider how you'll protect the endpoint and the data from unauthorized access. In this case just relying on obscurity isn't enough. You should also consider using an HTTPS connection and encrypting any sensitive data, although this will increase the load on the server.</p></blockquote></li></ul></li><li><p>How to access an endpoint that's secured using authentication. Not all tools and frameworks can be configured to include credentials with the health verification request. For example, Microsoft Azure built-in health verification features can't provide authentication credentials.

One approach is to expose an endpoint that simply returns a value from the application configuration or a random value that can be used to test the agent.</p><blockquote><p>Also ensure that the monitoring system performs checks on itself, such as a self-test and built-in test, to avoid it issuing false positive results.</p></blockquote></li></ul>

<p>Many data stores organize the data for a collection of entities using the primary key. An application can use this key to locate and retrieve data. The figure shows an example of a data store holding customer information. The primary key is the Customer ID. The figure shows customer information organized by the primary key (Customer ID).</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533366/463533360.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533366/463533360.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533360" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="index-table-figure-1.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533366" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>While the primary key is valuable for queries that fetch data based on the value of this key, an application might not be able to use the primary key if it needs to retrieve data based on some other field. In the customers example, an application can't use the Customer ID primary key to retrieve customers if it queries data solely by referencing the value of some other attribute, such as the town in which the customer is located. To perform a query such as this, the application might have to fetch and examine every customer record, which could be a slow process.</p><p>Many relational database management systems support secondary indexes. A secondary index is a separate data structure that's organized by one or more nonprimary (secondary) key fields, and it indicates where the data for each indexed value is stored. The items in a secondary index are typically sorted by the value of the secondary keys to enable fast lookup of data. These indexes are usually maintained automatically by the database management system.</p><p>You can create as many secondary indexes as you need to support the different queries that your application performs. For example, in a Customers table in a relational database where the Customer ID is the primary key, it's beneficial to add a secondary index over the town field if the application frequently looks up customers by the town where they reside.</p><p>However, although secondary indexes are common in relational systems, most NoSQL data stores used by cloud applications don't provide an equivalent feature.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>If the data store doesn't support secondary indexes, you can emulate them manually by creating your own index tables. An index table organizes the data by a specified key. Three strategies are commonly used for structuring an index table, depending on the number of secondary indexes that are required and the nature of the queries that an application performs.</p><p>The first strategy is to duplicate the data in each index table but organize it by different keys (complete denormalization). The next figure shows index tables that organize the same customer information by Town and LastName.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533366/463533361.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533366/463533361.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533361" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="index-table-figure-2.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533366" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>This strategy is appropriate if the data is relatively static compared to the number of times it's queried using each key. If the data is more dynamic, the processing overhead of maintaining each index table becomes too large for this approach to be useful. Also, if the volume of data is very large, the amount of space required to store the duplicate data is significant.</p><p>The second strategy is to create normalized index tables organized by different keys and reference the original data by using the primary key rather than duplicating it, as shown in the following figure. The original data is called a fact table.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533366/463533362.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533366/463533362.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533362" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="index-table-figure-3.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533366" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>This technique saves space and reduces the overhead of maintaining duplicate data. The disadvantage is that an application has to perform two lookup operations to find data using a secondary key. It has to find the primary key for the data in the index table, and then use the primary key to look up the data in the fact table.</p><p>The third strategy is to create partially normalized index tables organized by different keys that duplicate frequently retrieved fields. Reference the fact table to access less frequently accessed fields. The next figure shows how commonly accessed data is duplicated in each index table.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533366/463533363.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533366/463533363.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533363" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="index-table-figure-4.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533366" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>With this strategy, you can strike a balance between the first two approaches. The data for common queries can be retrieved quickly by using a single lookup, while the space and maintenance overhead isn't as significant as duplicating the entire data set.</p><p>If an application frequently queries data by specifying a combination of values (for example, “Find all customers that live in Redmond and that have a last name of Smith”), you could implement the keys to the items in the index table as a concatenation of the Town attribute and the LastName attribute. The next figure shows an index table based on composite keys. The keys are sorted by Town, and then by LastName for records that have the same value for Town.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533366/463533364.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533366/463533364.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533364" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="index-table-figure-5.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533366" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>Index tables can speed up query operations over sharded data, and are especially useful where the shard key is hashed. The next figure shows an example where the shard key is a hash of the Customer ID. The index table can organize data by the nonhashed value (Town and LastName), and provide the hashed shard key as the lookup data. This can save the application from repeatedly calculating hash keys (an expensive operation) if it needs to retrieve data that falls within a range, or it needs to fetch data in order of the nonhashed key. For example, a query such as “Find all customers that live in Redmond” can be quickly resolved by locating the matching items in the index table, where they're all stored in a contiguous block. Then, follow the references to the customer data using the shard keys stored in the index table.</p><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="250" src="attachments/463533366/463533365.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533366/463533365.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533365" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="index-table-figure-6.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533366" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p><br/></p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><ul><li><p>The overhead of maintaining secondary indexes can be significant. You must analyze and understand the queries that your application uses. Only create index tables when they're likely to be used regularly. Don't create speculative index tables to support queries that an application doesn't perform, or performs only occasionally.</p></li><li><p>Duplicating data in an index table can add significant overhead in storage costs and the effort required to maintain multiple copies of data.</p></li><li><p>Implementing an index table as a normalized structure that references the original data requires an application to perform two lookup operations to find data. The first operation searches the index table to retrieve the primary key, and the second uses the primary key to fetch the data.</p></li><li><p>If a system incorporates a number of index tables over very large data sets, it can be difficult to maintain consistency between index tables and the original data. It might be possible to design the application around the eventual consistency model. For example, to insert, update, or delete data, an application could post a message to a queue and let a separate task perform the operation and maintain the index tables that reference this data asynchronously. For more information about implementing eventual consistency, see the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn589800.aspx" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Data Consistency Primer</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Microsoft Azure storage tables support transactional updates for changes made to data held in the same partition (referred to as entity group transactions). If you can store the data for a fact table and one or more index tables in the same partition, you can use this feature to help ensure consistency.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Index tables might themselves be partitioned or sharded.</p></li></ul>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>When to use this Pattern</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Use this pattern to improve query performance when an application frequently needs to retrieve data by using a key other than the primary (or shard) key.</p><p>This pattern might not be useful when:</p><ul><li>Data is volatile. An index table can become out of date very quickly, making it ineffective or making the overhead of maintaining the index table greater than any savings made by using it.</li><li>A field selected as the secondary key for an index table is nondiscriminating and can only have a small set of values (for example, gender).</li><li>The balance of the data values for a field selected as the secondary key for an index table are highly skewed. For example, if 90% of the records contain the same value in a field, then creating and maintaining an index table to look up data based on this field might create more overhead than scanning sequentially through the data. However, if queries very frequently target values that lie in the remaining 10%, this index can be useful. You should understand the queries that your application is performing, and how frequently they're performed.</li></ul>

<p>A single task instance should be elected to act as the leader, and this instance should coordinate the actions of the other subordinate task instances.

<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><ul><li>The process of electing a leader should be resilient to transient and persistent failures.</li><li>It must be possible to detect when the leader has failed or has become otherwise unavailable (such as due to a communications failure).

</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>When storing data, the priority for developers and data administrators is often focused on how the data is stored, as opposed to how it's read. The chosen storage format is usually closely related to the format of the data, requirements for managing data size and data integrity, and the kind of store in use. For example, when using NoSQL document store, the data is often represented as a series of aggregates, each containing all of the information for that entity.</p><p>However, this can have a negative effect on queries. When a query only needs a subset of the data from some entities, such as a summary of orders for several customers without all of the order details, it must extract all of the data for the relevant entities in order to obtain the required information.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>To support efficient querying, a common solution is to generate, in advance, a view that materializes the data in a format suited to the required results set. The Materialized View pattern describes generating prepopulated views of data in environments where the source data isn't in a suitable format for querying, where generating a suitable query is difficult, or where query performance is poor due to the nature of the data or the data store.</p><p>These materialized views, which only contain data required by a query, allow applications to quickly obtain the information they need. In addition to joining tables or combining data entities, materialized views can include the current values of calculated columns or data items, the results of combining values or executing transformations on the data items, and values specified as part of the query. A materialized view can even be optimized for just a single query.</p><p>A key point is that a materialized view and the data it contains is completely disposable because it can be entirely rebuilt from the source data stores. A materialized view is never updated directly by an application, and so it's a specialized cache.</p><p>When the source data for the view changes, the view must be updated to include the new information. You can schedule this to happen automatically, or when the system detects a change to the original data. In some cases it might be necessary to regenerate the view manually. The figure shows an example of how the Materialized View pattern might be used.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533369/463533368.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533369/463533368.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533368" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="materialized-view-pattern-diagram.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533369" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p><br/></p>

<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><p>How and when the view will be updated. Ideally it'll regenerate in response to an event indicating a change to the source data, although this can lead to excessive overhead if the source data changes rapidly. Alternatively, consider using a scheduled task, an external trigger, or a manual action to regenerate the view.</p><p>In some systems, such as when using the Event Sourcing pattern to maintain a store of only the events that modified the data, materialized views are necessary. Prepopulating views by examining all events to determine the current state might be the only way to obtain information from the event store. If you're not using Event Sourcing, you need to consider whether a materialized view is helpful or not. Materialized views tend to be specifically tailored to one, or a small number of queries. If many queries are used, materialized views can result in unacceptable storage capacity requirements and storage cost.</p><p>Consider the impact on data consistency when generating the view, and when updating the view if this occurs on a schedule. If the source data is changing at the point when the view is generated, the copy of the data in the view won't be fully consistent with the original data.</p><p>Consider where you'll store the view. The view doesn't have to be located in the same store or partition as the original data. It can be a subset from a few different partitions combined.</p><p>A view can be rebuilt if lost. Because of that, if the view is transient and is only used to improve query performance by reflecting the current state of the data, or to improve scalability, it can be stored in a cache or in a less reliable location.</p><p>When defining a materialized view, maximize its value by adding data items or columns to it based on computation or transformation of existing data items, on values passed in the query, or on combinations of these values when appropriate.</p><p>Where the storage mechanism supports it, consider indexing the materialized view to further increase performance. Most relational databases support indexing for views, as do big data solutions based on Apache Hadoop.</p>

<p>Break down the processing required for each stream into a set of separate components (or filters), each performing a single task. By standardizing the format of the data that each component receives and sends, these filters can be combined together into a pipeline. This helps to avoid duplicating code, and makes it easy to remove, replace, or integrate additional components if the processing requirements change. The next figure shows a solution implemented using pipes and filters.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533386/463533384.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533386/463533384.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533384" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="pipes-and-filters-solution.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533386" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>The time it takes to process a single request depends on the speed of the slowest filter in the pipeline. One or more filters could be a bottleneck, especially if a large number of requests appear in a stream from a particular data source. A key advantage of the pipeline structure is that it provides opportunities for running parallel instances of slow filters, enabling the system to spread the load and improve throughput.</p><p>The filters that make up a pipeline can run on different machines, enabling them to be scaled independently and take advantage of the elasticity that many cloud environments provide. A filter that is computationally intensive can run on high-performance hardware, while other less demanding filters can be hosted on less expensive commodity hardware. The filters don't even have to be in the same datacenter or geographic location, which allows each element in a pipeline to run in an environment close to the resources it requires. The next figure shows an example applied to the pipeline for the data from Source 1.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533386/463533385.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533386/463533385.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533385" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="pipes-and-filters-load-balancing.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533386" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>If the input and output of a filter are structured as a stream, it's possible to perform the processing for each filter in parallel. The first filter in the pipeline can start its work and output its results, which are passed directly on to the next filter in the sequence before the first filter has completed its work.</p><p>Another benefit is the resiliency that this model can provide. If a filter fails or the machine it's running on is no longer available, the pipeline can reschedule the work that the filter was performing and direct this work to another instance of the component. Failure of a single filter doesn't necessarily result in failure of the entire pipeline.</p><p>Using the Pipes and Filters pattern in conjunction with the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Compensating Transaction pattern</a> is an alternative approach to implementing distributed transactions. A distributed transaction can be broken down into separate, compensable tasks, each of which can be implemented by using a filter that also implements the Compensating Transaction pattern. The filters in a pipeline can be implemented as separate hosted tasks running close to the data that they maintain.</p>

<p>You should consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Complexity</strong>. The increased flexibility that this pattern provides can also introduce complexity, especially if the filters in a pipeline are distributed across different servers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reliability</strong>. Use an infrastructure that ensures that data flowing between filters in a pipeline won't be lost.</p></li><li><p><strong>Idempotency</strong>. If a filter in a pipeline fails after receiving a message and the work is rescheduled to another instance of the filter, part of the work might have already been completed. If this work updates some aspect of the global state (such as information stored in a database), the same update could be repeated. A similar issue might occur if a filter fails after posting its results to the next filter in the pipeline, but before indicating that it's completed its work successfully. In these cases, the same work could be repeated by another instance of the filter, causing the same results to be posted twice. This could result in subsequent filters in the pipeline processing the same data twice. Therefore filters in a pipeline should be designed to be idempotent. For more information, see <a href="https://blog.jonathanoliver.com/idempotency-patterns/" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Idempotency Patterns</a> on Jonathan Oliver’s blog.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repeated messages</strong>. If a filter in a pipeline fails after posting a message to the next stage of the pipeline, another instance of the filter might be run, and it'll post a copy of the same message to the pipeline. This could cause two instances of the same message to be passed to the next filter. To avoid this, the pipeline should detect and eliminate duplicate messages.</p><blockquote><p>If you're implementing the pipeline by using message queues (such as Microsoft Azure Service Bus queues), the message queuing infrastructure might provide automatic duplicate message detection and removal.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Context and state</strong>. In a pipeline, each filter essentially runs in isolation and shouldn't make any assumptions about how it was invoked. This means that each filter should be provided with sufficient context to perform its work. This context could include a large amount of state information.</p></li></ul>

<p>Applications can delegate specific tasks to other services, for example, to perform background processing or to integrate with other applications or services. In the cloud, a message queue is typically used to delegate tasks to background processing. In many cases the order requests are received in by a service isn't important. In some cases, though, it's necessary to prioritize specific requests. These requests should be processed earlier than lower priority requests that were sent previously by the application.</p>

<p>A queue is usually a first-in, first-out (FIFO) structure, and consumers typically receive messages in the same order that they were posted to the queue. However, some message queues support priority messaging. The application posting a message can assign a priority and the messages in the queue are automatically reordered so that those with a higher priority will be received before those with a lower priority. The figure illustrates a queue with priority messaging.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533389/463533387.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533389/463533387.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533387" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="priority-queue-pattern.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533389" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><blockquote><p>Most message queue implementations support multiple consumers (following the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/competing-consumers" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Competing Consumers pattern</a>), and the number of consumer processes can be scaled up or down depending on demand.</p></blockquote><p>In systems that don't support priority-based message queues, an alternative solution is to maintain a separate queue for each priority. The application is responsible for posting messages to the appropriate queue. Each queue can have a separate pool of consumers. Higher priority queues can have a larger pool of consumers running on faster hardware than lower priority queues. The next figure illustrates using separate message queues for each priority.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533389/463533388.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533389/463533388.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533388" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="priority-queue-separate.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533389" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>A variation on this strategy is to have a single pool of consumers that check for messages on high priority queues first, and only then start to fetch messages from lower priority queues. There are some semantic differences between a solution that uses a single pool of consumer processes (either with a single queue that supports messages with different priorities or with multiple queues that each handle messages of a single priority), and a solution that uses multiple queues with a separate pool for each queue.</p><p>In the single pool approach, higher priority messages are always received and processed before lower priority messages. In theory, messages that have a very low priority could be continually superseded and might never be processed. In the multiple pool approach, lower priority messages will always be processed, just not as quickly as those of a higher priority (depending on the relative size of the pools and the resources that they have available).</p><p>Using a priority queuing mechanism can provide the following advantages:</p><ul><li><p>It allows applications to meet business requirements that require prioritization of availability or performance, such as offering different levels of service to specific groups of customers.</p></li><li><p>It can help to minimize operational costs. In the single queue approach, you can scale back the number of consumers if necessary. High priority messages will still be processed first (although possibly more slowly), and lower priority messages might be delayed for longer. If you've implemented the multiple message queue approach with separate pools of consumers for each queue, you can reduce the pool of consumers for lower priority queues, or even suspend processing for some very low priority queues by stopping all the consumers that listen for messages on those queues.</p></li><li><p>The multiple message queue approach can help maximize application performance and scalability by partitioning messages based on processing requirements. For example, vital tasks can be prioritized to be handled by receivers that run immediately while less important background tasks can be handled by receivers that are scheduled to run at less busy periods.</p></li></ul>

<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><p>Define the priorities in the context of the solution.

</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Existing technologies.</strong> It is strongly recommended to use available messaging products and services that support a publish-subscribe model, rather than building your own. In Azure, consider using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Service Bus</a> or <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Event Grid</a>. Other technologies that can be used for pub/sub messaging include Redis, RabbitMQ, and Apache Kafka.</p></li><li><p><strong>Subscription handling.</strong> The messaging infrastructure must provide mechanisms that consumers can use to subscribe to or unsubscribe from available channels.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security.</strong> Connecting to any message channel must be restricted by security policy to prevent eavesdropping by unauthorized users or applications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Subsets of messages.</strong> Subscribers are usually only interested in subset of the messages distributed by a publisher. Messaging services often allow subscribers to narrow the set of messages received by:</p><ul><li><strong>Topics.</strong> Each topic has a dedicated output channel, and each consumer can subscribe to all relevant topics.</li><li><strong>Content filtering.</strong> Messages are inspected and distributed based on the content of each message. Each subscriber can specify the content it is interested in.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Wildcard subscribers.</strong> Consider allowing subscribers to subscribe to multiple topics via wildcards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bi-directional communication.</strong> The channels in a publish-subscribe system are treated as unidirectional. If a specific subscriber needs to send acknowledgment or communicate status back to the publisher, consider using the <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/RequestReply.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Request/Reply Pattern</a>. This pattern uses one channel to send a message to the subscriber, and a separate reply channel for communicating back to the publisher.</p></li><li><p><strong>Message ordering.</strong> The order in which consumer instances receive messages isn't guaranteed, and doesn't necessarily reflect the order in which the messages were created. Design the system to ensure that message processing is idempotent to help eliminate any dependency on the order of message handling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Message priority.</strong> Some solutions may require that messages are processed in a specific order. The <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/priority-queue" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Priority Queue pattern</a> provides a mechanism for ensuring specific messages are delivered before others.</p></li><li><p><strong>Poison messages.</strong> A malformed message, or a task that requires access to resources that aren't available, can cause a service instance to fail. The system should prevent such messages being returned to the queue. Instead, capture and store the details of these messages elsewhere so that they can be analyzed if necessary.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repeated messages.</strong> The same message might be sent more than once. For example, the sender might fail after posting a message. Then a new instance of the sender might start up and repeat the message. The messaging infrastructure should implement duplicate message detection and removal (also known as de-duping) based on message IDs in order to provide at-most-once delivery of messages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Message expiration.</strong> A message might have a limited lifetime. If it isn't processed within this period, it might no longer be relevant and should be discarded. A sender can specify an expiration time as part of the data in the message. A receiver can examine this information before deciding whether to perform the business logic associated with the message.</p></li><li><p><strong>Message scheduling.</strong> A message might be temporarily embargoed and should not be processed until a specific date and time. The message should not be available to a receiver until this time.</p></li></ul>

<p>Refactor the solution and introduce a queue between the task and the service. The task and the service run asynchronously. The task posts a message containing the data required by the service to a queue. The queue acts as a buffer, storing the message until it's retrieved by the service. The service retrieves the messages from the queue and processes them. Requests from a number of tasks, which can be generated at a highly variable rate, can be passed to the service through the same message queue.

<p>Enable an application to handle transient failures when it tries to connect to a service or network resource, by transparently retrying a failed operation. This can improve the stability of the application.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>An application that communicates with elements running in the cloud has to be sensitive to the transient faults that can occur in this environment. Faults include the momentary loss of network connectivity to components and services, the temporary unavailability of a service, or timeouts that occur when a service is busy.</p><p>These faults are typically self-correcting, and if the action that triggered a fault is repeated after a suitable delay it's likely to be successful. For example, a database service that's processing a large number of concurrent requests can implement a throttling strategy that temporarily rejects any further requests until its workload has eased. An application trying to access the database might fail to connect, but if it tries again after a delay it might succeed.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>In the cloud, transient faults aren't uncommon and an application should be designed to handle them elegantly and transparently. This minimizes the effects faults can have on the business tasks the application is performing.</p><p>If an application detects a failure when it tries to send a request to a remote service, it can handle the failure using the following strategies:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cancel</strong>. If the fault indicates that the failure isn't transient or is unlikely to be successful if repeated, the application should cancel the operation and report an exception. For example, an authentication failure caused by providing invalid credentials is not likely to succeed no matter how many times it's attempted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Retry</strong>. If the specific fault reported is unusual or rare, it might have been caused by unusual circumstances such as a network packet becoming corrupted while it was being transmitted. In this case, the application could retry the failing request again immediately because the same failure is unlikely to be repeated and the request will probably be successful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Retry after delay</strong>. If the fault is caused by one of the more commonplace connectivity or busy failures, the network or service might need a short period while the connectivity issues are corrected or the backlog of work is cleared. The application should wait for a suitable time before retrying the request.</p></li></ul><p>For the more common transient failures, the period between retries should be chosen to spread requests from multiple instances of the application as evenly as possible. This reduces the chance of a busy service continuing to be overloaded. If many instances of an application are continually overwhelming a service with retry requests, it'll take the service longer to recover.</p><p>If the request still fails, the application can wait and make another attempt. If necessary, this process can be repeated with increasing delays between retry attempts, until some maximum number of requests have been attempted. The delay can be increased incrementally or exponentially, depending on the type of failure and the probability that it'll be corrected during this time.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates invoking an operation in a hosted service using this pattern. If the request is unsuccessful after a predefined number of attempts, the application should treat the fault as an exception and handle it accordingly.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533395/463533394.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533395/463533394.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533394" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="retry-pattern.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533395" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>The application should wrap all attempts to access a remote service in code that implements a retry policy matching one of the strategies listed above. Requests sent to different services can be subject to different policies. Some vendors provide libraries that implement retry policies, where the application can specify the maximum number of retries, the time between retry attempts, and other parameters.</p><p>An application should log the details of faults and failing operations. This information is useful to operators. If a service is frequently unavailable or busy, it's often because the service has exhausted its resources. You can reduce the frequency of these faults by scaling out the service. For example, if a database service is continually overloaded, it might be beneficial to partition the database and spread the load across multiple servers.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Entity Framework</a> provides facilities for retrying database operations. Also, most Azure services and client SDKs include a retry mechanism. For more information, see <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/retry-service-specific" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Retry guidance for specific services</a>.</p></blockquote><p><br/></p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>You should consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern.</p><p>The retry policy should be tuned to match the business requirements of the application and the nature of the failure. For some noncritical operations, it's better to fail fast rather than retry several times and impact the throughput of the application. For example, in an interactive web application accessing a remote service, it's better to fail after a smaller number of retries with only a short delay between retry attempts, and display a suitable message to the user (for example, “please try again later”). For a batch application, it might be more appropriate to increase the number of retry attempts with an exponentially increasing delay between attempts.</p><p>An aggressive retry policy with minimal delay between attempts, and a large number of retries, could further degrade a busy service that's running close to or at capacity. This retry policy could also affect the responsiveness of the application if it's continually trying to perform a failing operation.</p><p>If a request still fails after a significant number of retries, it's better for the application to prevent further requests going to the same resource and simply report a failure immediately. When the period expires, the application can tentatively allow one or more requests through to see whether they're successful. For more details of this strategy, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Circuit Breaker pattern</a>.</p><p>Consider whether the operation is idempotent. If so, it's inherently safe to retry. Otherwise, retries could cause the operation to be executed more than once, with unintended side effects. For example, a service might receive the request, process the request successfully, but fail to send a response. At that point, the retry logic might re-send the request, assuming that the first request wasn't received.</p><p>A request to a service can fail for a variety of reasons raising different exceptions depending on the nature of the failure. Some exceptions indicate a failure that can be resolved quickly, while others indicate that the failure is longer lasting. It's useful for the retry policy to adjust the time between retry attempts based on the type of the exception.</p><p>Consider how retrying an operation that's part of a transaction will affect the overall transaction consistency. Fine tune the retry policy for transactional operations to maximize the chance of success and reduce the need to undo all the transaction steps.</p><p>Ensure that all retry code is fully tested against a variety of failure conditions. Check that it doesn't severely impact the performance or reliability of the application, cause excessive load on services and resources, or generate race conditions or bottlenecks.</p><p>Implement retry logic only where the full context of a failing operation is understood. For example, if a task that contains a retry policy invokes another task that also contains a retry policy, this extra layer of retries can add long delays to the processing. It might be better to configure the lower-level task to fail fast and report the reason for the failure back to the task that invoked it. This higher-level task can then handle the failure based on its own policy.</p><p>It's important to log all connectivity failures that cause a retry so that underlying problems with the application, services, or resources can be identified.</p><p>Investigate the faults that are most likely to occur for a service or a resource to discover if they're likely to be long lasting or terminal. If they are, it's better to handle the fault as an exception. The application can report or log the exception, and then try to continue either by invoking an alternative service (if one is available), or by offering degraded functionality.

<p>The Scheduler Agent Supervisor pattern defines the following actors. These actors orchestrate the steps to be performed as part of the overall task.</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>Scheduler</strong> arranges for the steps that make up the task to be executed and orchestrates their operation. These steps can be combined into a pipeline or workflow. The Scheduler is responsible for ensuring that the steps in this workflow are performed in the right order. As each step is performed, the Scheduler records the state of the workflow, such as &quot;step not yet started,&quot; &quot;step running,&quot; or &quot;step completed.&quot; The state information should also include an upper limit of the time allowed for the step to finish, called the complete-by time. If a step requires access to a remote service or resource, the Scheduler invokes the appropriate Agent, passing it the details of the work to be performed. The Scheduler typically communicates with an Agent using asynchronous request/response messaging. This can be implemented using queues, although other distributed messaging technologies could be used instead.</p><blockquote><p>The Scheduler performs a similar function to the Process Manager in the <a href="https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/ProcessManager.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Process Manager pattern</a>. The actual workflow is typically defined and implemented by a workflow engine that's controlled by the Scheduler. This approach decouples the business logic in the workflow from the Scheduler.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>The <strong>Agent</strong> contains logic that encapsulates a call to a remote service, or access to a remote resource referenced by a step in a task. Each Agent typically wraps calls to a single service or resource, implementing the appropriate error handling and retry logic (subject to a timeout constraint, described later). If the steps in the workflow being run by the Scheduler use several services and resources across different steps, each step might reference a different Agent (this is an implementation detail of the pattern).</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Supervisor</strong> monitors the status of the steps in the task being performed by the Scheduler. It runs periodically (the frequency will be system-specific), and examines the status of steps maintained by the Scheduler. If it detects any that have timed out or failed, it arranges for the appropriate Agent to recover the step or execute the appropriate remedial action (this might involve modifying the status of a step). Note that the recovery or remedial actions are implemented by the Scheduler and Agents. The Supervisor should simply request that these actions be performed.</p></li></ul><p>The Scheduler, Agent, and Supervisor are logical components and their physical implementation depends on the technology being used. For example, several logical agents might be implemented as part of a single web service.</p><p>The Scheduler maintains information about the progress of the task and the state of each step in a durable data store, called the state store. The Supervisor can use this information to help determine whether a step has failed. The figure illustrates the relationship between the Scheduler, the Agents, the Supervisor, and the state store.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533397/463533396.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533397/463533396.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533396" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="scheduler-agent-supervisor-pattern.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533397" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><blockquote><p>This diagram shows a simplified version of the pattern. In a real implementation, there might be many instances of the Scheduler running concurrently, each a subset of tasks. Similarly, the system could run multiple instances of each Agent, or even multiple Supervisors. In this case, Supervisors must coordinate their work with each other carefully to ensure that they don’t compete to recover the same failed steps and tasks. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/leader-election" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Leader Election pattern</a> provides one possible solution to this problem.</p></blockquote><p>When the application is ready to run a task, it submits a request to the Scheduler. The Scheduler records initial state information about the task and its steps (for example, step not yet started) in the state store and then starts performing the operations defined by the workflow. As the Scheduler starts each step, it updates the information about the state of that step in the state store (for example, step running).</p><p>If a step references a remote service or resource, the Scheduler sends a message to the appropriate Agent. The message contains the information that the Agent needs to pass to the service or access the resource, in addition to the complete-by time for the operation. If the Agent completes its operation successfully, it returns a response to the Scheduler. The Scheduler can then update the state information in the state store (for example, step completed) and perform the next step. This process continues until the entire task is complete.</p><p>An Agent can implement any retry logic that's necessary to perform its work. However, if the Agent doesn't complete its work before the complete-by period expires, the Scheduler will assume that the operation has failed. In this case, the Agent should stop its work and not try to return anything to the Scheduler (not even an error message), or try any form of recovery. The reason for this restriction is that, after a step has timed out or failed, another instance of the Agent might be scheduled to run the failing step (this process is described later).</p><p>If the Agent fails, the Scheduler won't receive a response. The pattern doesn't make a distinction between a step that has timed out and one that has genuinely failed.</p><p>If a step times out or fails, the state store will contain a record that indicates that the step is running, but the complete-by time will have passed. The Supervisor looks for steps like this and tries to recover them. One possible strategy is for the Supervisor to update the complete-by value to extend the time available to complete the step, and then send a message to the Scheduler identifying the step that has timed out. The Scheduler can then try to repeat this step. However, this design requires the tasks to be idempotent.</p><p>The Supervisor might need to prevent the same step from being retried if it continually fails or times out. To do this, the Supervisor could maintain a retry count for each step, along with the state information, in the state store. If this count exceeds a predefined threshold the Supervisor can adopt a strategy of waiting for an extended period before notifying the Scheduler that it should retry the step, in the expectation that the fault will be resolved during this period. Alternatively, the Supervisor can send a message to the Scheduler to request the entire task be undone by implementing a <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Compensating Transaction pattern</a>. This approach will depend on the Scheduler and Agents providing the information necessary to implement the compensating operations for each step that completed successfully.</p><blockquote><p>It isn't the purpose of the Supervisor to monitor the Scheduler and Agents, and restart them if they fail. This aspect of the system should be handled by the infrastructure these components are running in. Similarly, the Supervisor shouldn't have knowledge of the actual business operations that the tasks being performed by the Scheduler are running (including how to compensate should these tasks fail). This is the purpose of the workflow logic implemented by the Scheduler. The sole responsibility of the Supervisor is to determine whether a step has failed and arrange either for it to be repeated or for the entire task containing the failed step to be undone.</p></blockquote><p>If the Scheduler is restarted after a failure, or the workflow being performed by the Scheduler terminates unexpectedly, the Scheduler should be able to determine the status of any inflight task that it was handling when it failed, and be prepared to resume this task from that point. The implementation details of this process are likely to be system-specific. If the task can't be recovered, it might be necessary to undo the work already performed by the task. This might also require implementing a <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">compensating transaction</a>.</p><p>The key advantage of this pattern is that the system is resilient in the event of unexpected temporary or unrecoverable failures. The system can be constructed to be self-healing. For example, if an Agent or the Scheduler fails, a new one can be started and the Supervisor can arrange for a task to be resumed. If the Supervisor fails, another instance can be started and can take over from where the failure occurred. If the Supervisor is scheduled to run periodically, a new instance can be automatically started after a predefined interval. The state store can be replicated to reach an even greater degree of resiliency.</p>

The Scheduler typically communicates with an Agent using asynchronous request/response messaging. This can be implemented using queues, although other distributed messaging technologies could be used instead.</p><blockquote><p>The Scheduler performs a similar function to the Process Manager in the <a href="https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/ProcessManager.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Process Manager pattern</a>. The actual workflow is typically defined and implemented by a workflow engine that's controlled by the Scheduler. This approach decouples the business logic in the workflow from the Scheduler.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>The <strong>Agent</strong> contains logic that encapsulates a call to a remote service, or access to a remote resource referenced by a step in a task. Each Agent typically wraps calls to a single service or resource, implementing the appropriate error handling and retry logic (subject to a timeout constraint, described later). If the steps in the workflow being run by the Scheduler use several services and resources across different steps, each step might reference a different Agent (this is an implementation detail of the pattern).</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Supervisor</strong> monitors the status of the steps in the task being performed by the Scheduler. It runs periodically (the frequency will be system-specific), and examines the status of steps maintained by the Scheduler. If it detects any that have timed out or failed, it arranges for the appropriate Agent to recover the step or execute the appropriate remedial action (this might involve modifying the status of a step). Note that the recovery or remedial actions are implemented by the Scheduler and Agents. The Supervisor should simply request that these actions be performed.</p></li></ul><p>The Scheduler, Agent, and Supervisor are logical components and their physical implementation depends on the technology being used. For example, several logical agents might be implemented as part of a single web service.</p><p>The Scheduler maintains information about the progress of the task and the state of each step in a durable data store, called the state store. The Supervisor can use this information to help determine whether a step has failed. The figure illustrates the relationship between the Scheduler, the Agents, the Supervisor, and the state store.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533397/463533396.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533397/463533396.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533396" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="scheduler-agent-supervisor-pattern.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533397" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><blockquote><p>This diagram shows a simplified version of the pattern. In a real implementation, there might be many instances of the Scheduler running concurrently, each a subset of tasks. Similarly, the system could run multiple instances of each Agent, or even multiple Supervisors. In this case, Supervisors must coordinate their work with each other carefully to ensure that they don’t compete to recover the same failed steps and tasks. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/leader-election" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Leader Election pattern</a> provides one possible solution to this problem.</p></blockquote><p>When the application is ready to run a task, it submits a request to the Scheduler. The Scheduler records initial state information about the task and its steps (for example, step not yet started) in the state store and then starts performing the operations defined by the workflow. As the Scheduler starts each step, it updates the information about the state of that step in the state store (for example, step running).</p><p>If a step references a remote service or resource, the Scheduler sends a message to the appropriate Agent. The message contains the information that the Agent needs to pass to the service or access the resource, in addition to the complete-by time for the operation. If the Agent completes its operation successfully, it returns a response to the Scheduler. The Scheduler can then update the state information in the state store (for example, step completed) and perform the next step. This process continues until the entire task is complete.</p><p>An Agent can implement any retry logic that's necessary to perform its work. However, if the Agent doesn't complete its work before the complete-by period expires, the Scheduler will assume that the operation has failed. In this case, the Agent should stop its work and not try to return anything to the Scheduler (not even an error message), or try any form of recovery. The reason for this restriction is that, after a step has timed out or failed, another instance of the Agent might be scheduled to run the failing step (this process is described later).</p><p>If the Agent fails, the Scheduler won't receive a response. The pattern doesn't make a distinction between a step that has timed out and one that has genuinely failed.</p><p>If a step times out or fails, the state store will contain a record that indicates that the step is running, but the complete-by time will have passed. The Supervisor looks for steps like this and tries to recover them. One possible strategy is for the Supervisor to update the complete-by value to extend the time available to complete the step, and then send a message to the Scheduler identifying the step that has timed out. The Scheduler can then try to repeat this step. However, this design requires the tasks to be idempotent.</p><p>The Supervisor might need to prevent the same step from being retried if it continually fails or times out. To do this, the Supervisor could maintain a retry count for each step, along with the state information, in the state store. If this count exceeds a predefined threshold the Supervisor can adopt a strategy of waiting for an extended period before notifying the Scheduler that it should retry the step, in the expectation that the fault will be resolved during this period. Alternatively, the Supervisor can send a message to the Scheduler to request the entire task be undone by implementing a <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Compensating Transaction pattern</a>. This approach will depend on the Scheduler and Agents providing the information necessary to implement the compensating operations for each step that completed successfully.</p><blockquote><p>It isn't the purpose of the Supervisor to monitor the Scheduler and Agents, and restart them if they fail. This aspect of the system should be handled by the infrastructure these components are running in. Similarly, the Supervisor shouldn't have knowledge of the actual business operations that the tasks being performed by the Scheduler are running (including how to compensate should these tasks fail). This is the purpose of the workflow logic implemented by the Scheduler. The sole responsibility of the Supervisor is to determine whether a step has failed and arrange either for it to be repeated or for the entire task containing the failed step to be undone.</p></blockquote><p>If the Scheduler is restarted after a failure, or the workflow being performed by the Scheduler terminates unexpectedly, the Scheduler should be able to determine the status of any inflight task that it was handling when it failed, and be prepared to resume this task from that point. The implementation details of this process are likely to be system-specific. If the task can't be recovered, it might be necessary to undo the work already performed by the task. This might also require implementing a <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">compensating transaction</a>.</p><p>The key advantage of this pattern is that the system is resilient in the event of unexpected temporary or unrecoverable failures. The system can be constructed to be self-healing. For example, if an Agent or the Scheduler fails, a new one can be started and the Supervisor can arrange for a task to be resumed. If the Supervisor fails, another instance can be started and can take over from where the failure occurred. If the Supervisor is scheduled to run periodically, a new instance can be automatically started after a predefined interval. The state store can be replicated to reach an even greater degree of resiliency.</p>

</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>A data store hosted by a single server might be subject to the following limitations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Storage space</strong>. A data store for a large-scale cloud application is expected to contain a huge volume of data that could increase significantly over time. A server typically provides only a finite amount of disk storage, but you can replace existing disks with larger ones, or add further disks to a machine as data volumes grow. However, the system will eventually reach a limit where it isn't possible to easily increase the storage capacity on a given server.</p></li><li><p><strong>Computing resources</strong>. A cloud application is required to support a large number of concurrent users, each of which run queries that retrieve information from the data store. A single server hosting the data store might not be able to provide the necessary computing power to support this load, resulting in extended response times for users and frequent failures as applications attempting to store and retrieve data time out. It might be possible to add memory or upgrade processors, but the system will reach a limit when it isn't possible to increase the compute resources any further.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network bandwidth</strong>. Ultimately, the performance of a data store running on a single server is governed by the rate the server can receive requests and send replies. It's possible that the volume of network traffic might exceed the capacity of the network used to connect to the server, resulting in failed requests.</p></li><li><p><strong>Geography</strong>. It might be necessary to store data generated by specific users in the same region as those users for legal, compliance, or performance reasons, or to reduce latency of data access. If the users are dispersed across different countries or regions, it might not be possible to store the entire data for the application in a single data store.</p></li></ul><p>Scaling vertically by adding more disk capacity, processing power, memory, and network connections can postpone the effects of some of these limitations, but it's likely to only be a temporary solution. A commercial cloud application capable of supporting large numbers of users and high volumes of data must be able to scale almost indefinitely, so vertical scaling isn't necessarily the best solution.</p>

<p>Divide the data store into horizontal partitions or shards. Each shard has the same schema, but holds its own distinct subset of the data. A shard is a data store in its own right (it can contain the data for many entities of different types), running on a server acting as a storage node.</p><p>This pattern has the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You can scale the system out by adding further shards running on additional storage nodes.</p></li><li><p>A system can use off-the-shelf hardware rather than specialized and expensive computers for each storage node.</p></li><li><p>You can reduce contention and improve performance by balancing the workload across shards.</p></li><li><p>In the cloud, shards can be located physically close to the users that'll access the data.</p></li></ul><p>When dividing a data store up into shards, decide which data should be placed in each shard. A shard typically contains items that fall within a specified range determined by one or more attributes of the data. These attributes form the shard key (sometimes referred to as the partition key). The shard key should be static. It shouldn't be based on data that might change.</p><p>Sharding physically organizes the data. When an application stores and retrieves data, the sharding logic directs the application to the appropriate shard. This sharding logic can be implemented as part of the data access code in the application, or it could be implemented by the data storage system if it transparently supports sharding.</p><p>Abstracting the physical location of the data in the sharding logic provides a high level of control over which shards contain which data. It also enables data to migrate between shards without reworking the business logic of an application if the data in the shards need to be redistributed later (for example, if the shards become unbalanced). The tradeoff is the additional data access overhead required in determining the location of each data item as it's retrieved.</p><p>To ensure optimal performance and scalability, it's important to split the data in a way that's appropriate for the types of queries that the application performs. In many cases, it's unlikely that the sharding scheme will exactly match the requirements of every query. For example, in a multi-tenant system an application might need to retrieve tenant data using the tenant ID, but it might also need to look up this data based on some other attribute such as the tenant’s name or location. To handle these situations, implement a sharding strategy with a shard key that supports the most commonly performed queries.</p><p>If queries regularly retrieve data using a combination of attribute values, you can likely define a composite shard key by linking attributes together. Alternatively, use a pattern such as <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/index-table" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Index Table</a> to provide fast lookup to data based on attributes that aren't covered by the shard key.</p><h2 id="Cloud-ShardingStrategies">Sharding Strategies</h2><p>Three strategies are commonly used when selecting the shard key and deciding how to distribute data across shards. Note that there doesn't have to be a one-to-one correspondence between shards and the servers that host them—a single server can host multiple shards. The strategies are:</p><p><strong>The Lookup strategy</strong>. In this strategy the sharding logic implements a map that routes a request for data to the shard that contains that data using the shard key. In a multi-tenant application all the data for a tenant might be stored together in a shard using the tenant ID as the shard key. Multiple tenants might share the same shard, but the data for a single tenant won't be spread across multiple shards. The figure illustrates sharding tenant data based on tenant IDs.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533404/463533401.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533404/463533401.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533401" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="sharding-tenant.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533404" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>The mapping between the shard key and the physical storage can be based on physical shards where each shard key maps to a physical partition. Alternatively, a more flexible technique for rebalancing shards is virtual partitioning, where shard keys map to the same number of virtual shards, which in turn map to fewer physical partitions. In this approach, an application locates data using a shard key that refers to a virtual shard, and the system transparently maps virtual shards to physical partitions. The mapping between a virtual shard and a physical partition can change without requiring the application code be modified to use a different set of shard keys.</p><p><strong>The Range strategy</strong>. This strategy groups related items together in the same shard, and orders them by shard key—the shard keys are sequential. It's useful for applications that frequently retrieve sets of items using range queries (queries that return a set of data items for a shard key that falls within a given range). For example, if an application regularly needs to find all orders placed in a given month, this data can be retrieved more quickly if all orders for a month are stored in date and time order in the same shard. If each order was stored in a different shard, they'd have to be fetched individually by performing a large number of point queries (queries that return a single data item). The next figure illustrates storing sequential sets (ranges) of data in shard.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533404/463533402.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533404/463533402.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533402" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="sharding-sequential-sets.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533404" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>In this example, the shard key is a composite key containing the order month as the most significant element, followed by the order day and the time. The data for orders is naturally sorted when new orders are created and added to a shard. Some data stores support two-part shard keys containing a partition key element that identifies the shard and a row key that uniquely identifies an item in the shard. Data is usually held in row key order in the shard. Items that are subject to range queries and need to be grouped together can use a shard key that has the same value for the partition key but a unique value for the row key.</p><p><strong>The Hash strategy</strong>. The purpose of this strategy is to reduce the chance of hotspots (shards that receive a disproportionate amount of load). It distributes the data across the shards in a way that achieves a balance between the size of each shard and the average load that each shard will encounter. The sharding logic computes the shard to store an item in based on a hash of one or more attributes of the data. The chosen hashing function should distribute data evenly across the shards, possibly by introducing some random element into the computation. The next figure illustrates sharding tenant data based on a hash of tenant IDs.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533404/463533403.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533404/463533403.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533403" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="sharding-data-hash.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533404" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p><br/></p><p>To understand the advantage of the Hash strategy over other sharding strategies, consider how a multi-tenant application that enrolls new tenants sequentially might assign the tenants to shards in the data store. When using the Range strategy, the data for tenants 1 to n will all be stored in shard A, the data for tenants n+1 to m will all be stored in shard B, and so on. If the most recently registered tenants are also the most active, most data activity will occur in a small number of shards, which could cause hotspots. In contrast, the Hash strategy allocates tenants to shards based on a hash of their tenant ID. This means that sequential tenants are most likely to be allocated to different shards, which will distribute the load across them. The previous figure shows this for tenants 55 and 56.</p><p>The three sharding strategies have the following advantages and considerations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lookup</strong>. This offers more control over the way that shards are configured and used. Using virtual shards reduces the impact when rebalancing data because new physical partitions can be added to even out the workload. The mapping between a virtual shard and the physical partitions that implement the shard can be modified without affecting application code that uses a shard key to store and retrieve data. Looking up shard locations can impose an additional overhead.</p></li><li><p><strong>Range</strong>. This is easy to implement and works well with range queries because they can often fetch multiple data items from a single shard in a single operation. This strategy offers easier data management. For example, if users in the same region are in the same shard, updates can be scheduled in each time zone based on the local load and demand pattern. However, this strategy doesn't provide optimal balancing between shards. Rebalancing shards is difficult and might not resolve the problem of uneven load if the majority of activity is for adjacent shard keys.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hash</strong>. This strategy offers a better chance of more even data and load distribution. Request routing can be accomplished directly by using the hash function. There's no need to maintain a map. Note that computing the hash might impose an additional overhead. Also, rebalancing shards is difficult.</p></li></ul><p>Most common sharding systems implement one of the approaches described above, but you should also consider the business requirements of your applications and their patterns of data usage. For example, in a multi-tenant application:</p><ul><li><p>You can shard data based on workload. You could segregate the data for highly volatile tenants in separate shards. The speed of data access for other tenants might be improved as a result.</p></li><li><p>You can shard data based on the location of tenants. You can take the data for tenants in a specific geographic region offline for backup and maintenance during off-peak hours in that region, while the data for tenants in other regions remains online and accessible during their business hours.</p></li><li><p>High-value tenants could be assigned their own private, high performing, lightly loaded shards, whereas lower-value tenants might be expected to share more densely-packed, busy shards.</p></li><li><p>The data for tenants that need a high degree of data isolation and privacy can be stored on a completely separate server.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Cloud-Scalinganddatamovementoperations">Scaling and data movement operations</h2><p>Each of the sharding strategies implies different capabilities and levels of complexity for managing scale in, scale out, data movement, and maintaining state.</p><p>The Lookup strategy permits scaling and data movement operations to be carried out at the user level, either online or offline. The technique is to suspend some or all user activity (perhaps during off-peak periods), move the data to the new virtual partition or physical shard, change the mappings, invalidate or refresh any caches that hold this data, and then allow user activity to resume. Often this type of operation can be centrally managed. The Lookup strategy requires state to be highly cacheable and replica friendly.</p><p>The Range strategy imposes some limitations on scaling and data movement operations, which must typically be carried out when a part or all of the data store is offline because the data must be split and merged across the shards. Moving the data to rebalance shards might not resolve the problem of uneven load if the majority of activity is for adjacent shard keys or data identifiers that are within the same range. The Range strategy might also require some state to be maintained in order to map ranges to the physical partitions.</p><p>The Hash strategy makes scaling and data movement operations more complex because the partition keys are hashes of the shard keys or data identifiers. The new location of each shard must be determined from the hash function, or the function modified to provide the correct mappings. However, the Hash strategy doesn't require maintenance of state.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><ul><li><p>Sharding is complementary to other forms of partitioning, such as vertical partitioning and functional partitioning. For example, a single shard can contain entities that have been partitioned vertically, and a functional partition can be implemented as multiple shards. For more information about partitioning, see the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn589795.aspx" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Data Partitioning Guidance</a>.</p></li><li><p>Keep shards balanced so they all handle a similar volume of I/O. As data is inserted and deleted, it's necessary to periodically rebalance the shards to guarantee an even distribution and to reduce the chance of hotspots. Rebalancing can be an expensive operation. To reduce the necessity of rebalancing, plan for growth by ensuring that each shard contains sufficient free space to handle the expected volume of changes. You should also develop strategies and scripts you can use to quickly rebalance shards if this becomes necessary.</p></li><li><p>Use stable data for the shard key. If the shard key changes, the corresponding data item might have to move between shards, increasing the amount of work performed by update operations. For this reason, avoid basing the shard key on potentially volatile information. Instead, look for attributes that are invariant or that naturally form a key.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that shard keys are unique. For example, avoid using autoincrementing fields as the shard key. Is some systems, autoincremented fields can't be coordinated across shards, possibly resulting in items in different shards having the same shard key.</p><blockquote><p>Autoincremented values in other fields that are not shard keys can also cause problems. For example, if you use autoincremented fields to generate unique IDs, then two different items located in different shards might be assigned the same ID.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It might not be possible to design a shard key that matches the requirements of every possible query against the data. Shard the data to support the most frequently performed queries, and if necessary create secondary index tables to support queries that retrieve data using criteria based on attributes that aren't part of the shard key. For more information, see the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/index-table" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Index Table pattern</a>.</p></li><li><p>Queries that access only a single shard are more efficient than those that retrieve data from multiple shards, so avoid implementing a sharding system that results in applications performing large numbers of queries that join data held in different shards. Remember that a single shard can contain the data for multiple types of entities. Consider denormalizing your data to keep related entities that are commonly queried together (such as the details of customers and the orders that they have placed) in the same shard to reduce the number of separate reads that an application performs.</p><blockquote><p>If an entity in one shard references an entity stored in another shard, include the shard key for the second entity as part of the schema for the first entity. This can help to improve the performance of queries that reference related data across shards.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>If an application must perform queries that retrieve data from multiple shards, it might be possible to fetch this data by using parallel tasks. Examples include fan-out queries, where data from multiple shards is retrieved in parallel and then aggregated into a single result. However, this approach inevitably adds some complexity to the data access logic of a solution.</p></li><li><p>For many applications, creating a larger number of small shards can be more efficient than having a small number of large shards because they can offer increased opportunities for load balancing. This can also be useful if you anticipate the need to migrate shards from one physical location to another. Moving a small shard is quicker than moving a large one.</p></li><li><p>Make sure the resources available to each shard storage node are sufficient to handle the scalability requirements in terms of data size and throughput. For more information, see the section “Designing Partitions for Scalability” in the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn589795.aspx" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Data Partitioning Guidance</a>.</p></li><li><p>Consider replicating reference data to all shards. If an operation that retrieves data from a shard also references static or slow-moving data as part of the same query, add this data to the shard. The application can then fetch all of the data for the query easily, without having to make an additional round trip to a separate data store.</p><blockquote><p>If reference data held in multiple shards changes, the system must synchronize these changes across all shards. The system can experience a degree of inconsistency while this synchronization occurs. If you do this, you should design your applications to be able to handle it.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It can be difficult to maintain referential integrity and consistency between shards, so you should minimize operations that affect data in multiple shards. If an application must modify data across shards, evaluate whether complete data consistency is actually required. Instead, a common approach in the cloud is to implement eventual consistency. The data in each partition is updated separately, and the application logic must take responsibility for ensuring that the updates all complete successfully, as well as handling the inconsistencies that can arise from querying data while an eventually consistent operation is running. For more information about implementing eventual consistency, see the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn589800.aspx" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Data Consistency Primer</a>.</p></li><li><p>Configuring and managing a large number of shards can be a challenge. Tasks such as monitoring, backing up, checking for consistency, and logging or auditing must be accomplished on multiple shards and servers, possibly held in multiple locations. These tasks are likely to be implemented using scripts or other automation solutions, but that might not completely eliminate the additional administrative requirements.</p></li><li><p>Shards can be geolocated so that the data that they contain is close to the instances of an application that use it. This approach can considerably improve performance, but requires additional consideration for tasks that must access multiple shards in different locations.</p></li></ul>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>When to use this Pattern</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Use this pattern when a data store is likely to need to scale beyond the resources available to a single storage node, or to improve performance by reducing contention in a data store.</p><p>The primary focus of sharding is to improve the performance and scalability of a system, but as a by-product it can also improve availability due to how the data is divided into separate partitions. A failure in one partition doesn't necessarily prevent an application from accessing data held in other partitions, and an operator can perform maintenance or recovery of one or more partitions without making the entire data for an application inaccessible.

<p>Deploy components of an application into a separate process or container to provide isolation and encapsulation. This pattern can also enable applications to be composed of heterogeneous components and technologies.</p><p>This pattern is named <em>Sidecar</em> because it resembles a sidecar attached to a motorcycle. In the pattern, the sidecar is attached to a parent application and provides supporting features for the application. The sidecar also shares the same lifecycle as the parent application, being created and retired alongside the parent. The sidecar pattern is sometimes referred to as the sidekick pattern and is a decomposition pattern.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Applications and services often require related functionality, such as monitoring, logging, configuration, and networking services. These peripheral tasks can be implemented as separate components or services.</p><p>If they are tightly integrated into the application, they can run in the same process as the application, making efficient use of shared resources. However, this also means they are not well isolated, and an outage in one of these components can affect other components or the entire application. Also, they usually need to be implemented using the same language as the parent application. As a result, the component and the application have close interdependence on each other.</p><p>If the application is decomposed into services, then each service can be built using different languages and technologies. While this gives more flexibility, it means that each component has its own dependencies and requires language-specific libraries to access the underlying platform and any resources shared with the parent application. In addition, deploying these features as separate services can add latency to the application. Managing the code and dependencies for these language-specific interfaces can also add considerable complexity, especially for hosting, deployment, and management.</p>

For each instance of the application, an instance of the sidecar is deployed and hosted alongside it.</p><p>Advantages of using a sidecar pattern include:</p><ul><li><p>A sidecar is independent from its primary application in terms of runtime environment and programming language, so you don't need to develop one sidecar per language.</p></li><li><p>The sidecar can access the same resources as the primary application.

<p>Control the consumption of resources used by an instance of an application, an individual tenant, or an entire service. This can allow the system to continue to function and meet service level agreements, even when an increase in demand places an extreme load on resources.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>The load on a cloud application typically varies over time based on the number of active users or the types of activities they are performing. For example, more users are likely to be active during business hours, or the system might be required to perform computationally expensive analytics at the end of each month. There might also be sudden and unanticipated bursts in activity. If the processing requirements of the system exceed the capacity of the resources that are available, it'll suffer from poor performance and can even fail. If the system has to meet an agreed level of service, such failure could be unacceptable.</p><p>There're many strategies available for handling varying load in the cloud, depending on the business goals for the application. One strategy is to use autoscaling to match the provisioned resources to the user needs at any given time. This has the potential to consistently meet user demand, while optimizing running costs. However, while autoscaling can trigger the provisioning of additional resources, this provisioning isn't immediate. If demand grows quickly, there can be a window of time where there's a resource deficit.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>An alternative strategy to autoscaling is to allow applications to use resources only up to a limit, and then throttle them when this limit is reached. The system should monitor how it's using resources so that, when usage exceeds the threshold, it can throttle requests from one or more users. This will enable the system to continue functioning and meet any service level agreements (SLAs) that are in place. For more information on monitoring resource usage, see the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn589775.aspx" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Instrumentation and Telemetry Guidance</a>.</p><p>The system could implement several throttling strategies, including:</p><ul><li><p>Rejecting requests from an individual user who's already accessed system APIs more than n times per second over a given period of time.

In a multi-tenant environment, this approach will reduce the performance for every tenant. If the system must support a mix of tenants with different SLAs, the work for high-value tenants might be performed immediately.

Aggregating the areas for each feature shows the total resource use of the system.</p></blockquote><p>The previous figure illustrates the effects of deferring operations. Just prior to time T1, the total resources allocated to all applications using these features reach a threshold (the limit of resource use). At this point, the applications are in danger of exhausting the resources available. In this system, Feature B is less critical than Feature A or Feature C, so it's temporarily disabled and the resources that it was using are released. Between times T1 and T2, the applications using Feature A and Feature C continue running as normal. Eventually, the resource use of these two features diminishes to the point when, at time T2, there is sufficient capacity to enable Feature B again.</p><p>The autoscaling and throttling approaches can also be combined to help keep the applications responsive and within SLAs. If the demand is expected to remain high, throttling provides a temporary solution while the system scales out.

At this point, the system can start to scale out. However, if the new resources don't become available quickly enough, then the existing resources might be exhausted and the system could fail. To prevent this from occurring, the system is temporarily throttled, as described earlier. When autoscaling has completed and the additional resources are available, throttling can be relaxed.</p>

<p>You should consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><ul><li><p>Throttling an application, and the strategy to use, is an architectural decision that impacts the entire design of a system. Throttling should be considered early in the application design process because it isn't easy to add once a system has been implemented.</p></li><li><p>Throttling must be performed quickly.

<p>Use a token that provides clients with restricted direct access to a specific resource, in order to offload data transfer from the application. This is particularly useful in applications that use cloud-hosted storage systems or queues, and can minimize cost and maximize scalability and performance.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Context and Problem</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Client programs and web browsers often need to read and write files or data streams to and from an application’s storage. Typically, the application will handle the movement of the data — either by fetching it from storage and streaming it to the client, or by reading the uploaded stream from the client and storing it in the data store. However, this approach absorbs valuable resources such as compute, memory, and bandwidth.</p><p>Data stores have the ability to handle upload and download of data directly, without requiring that the application perform any processing to move this data. But, this typically requires the client to have access to the security credentials for the store. This can be a useful technique to minimize data transfer costs and the requirement to scale out the application, and to maximize performance. It means, though, that the application is no longer able to manage the security of the data. After the client has a connection to the data store for direct access, the application can't act as the gatekeeper. It's no longer in control of the process and can't prevent subsequent uploads or downloads from the data store.</p><p>This isn't a realistic approach in distributed systems that need to serve untrusted clients. Instead, applications must be able to securely control access to data in a granular way, but still reduce the load on the server by setting up this connection and then allowing the client to communicate directly with the data store to perform the required read or write operations.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Solution</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>You need to resolve the problem of controlling access to a data store where the store can't manage authentication and authorization of clients. One typical solution is to restrict access to the data store’s public connection and provide the client with a key or token that the data store can validate.</p><p>This key or token is usually referred to as a valet key. It provides time-limited access to specific resources and allows only predefined operations such as reading and writing to storage or queues, or uploading and downloading in a web browser. Applications can create and issue valet keys to client devices and web browsers quickly and easily, allowing clients to perform the required operations without requiring the application to directly handle the data transfer. This removes the processing overhead, and the impact on performance and scalability, from the application and the server.</p><p>The client uses this token to access a specific resource in the data store for only a specific period, and with specific restrictions on access permissions, as shown in the figure. After the specified period, the key becomes invalid and won't allow access to the resource.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail confluence-content-image-border" height="150" src="attachments/463533414/463533413.png" data-image-src="attachments/463533414/463533413.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="463533413" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="valet-key-pattern.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.pinnacle.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="463533414" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"></p><p>It's also possible to configure a key that has other dependencies, such as the scope of the data. For example, depending on the data store capabilities, the key can specify a complete table in a data store, or only specific rows in a table. In cloud storage systems the key can specify a container, or just a specific item within a container.</p><p>The key can also be invalidated by the application. This is a useful approach if the client notifies the server that the data transfer operation is complete. The server can then invalidate that key to prevent further access.</p><p>Using this pattern can simplify managing access to resources because there's no requirement to create and authenticate a user, grant permissions, and then remove the user again. It also makes it easy to limit the location, the permission, and the validity period—all by simply generating a key at runtime. The important factors are to limit the validity period, and especially the location of the resource, as tightly as possible so that the recipient can only use it for the intended purpose.</p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>Issues and Considerations</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p><p><strong>Manage the validity status and period of the key</strong>. If leaked or compromised, the key effectively unlocks the target item and makes it available for malicious use during the validity period. A key can usually be revoked or disabled, depending on how it was issued. Server-side policies can be changed or, the server key it was signed with can be invalidated. Specify a short validity period to minimize the risk of allowing unauthorized operations to take place against the data store. However, if the validity period is too short, the client might not be able to complete the operation before the key expires. Allow authorized users to renew the key before the validity period expires if multiple accesses to the protected resource are required.</p><p><strong>Control the level of access the key will provide</strong>. Typically, the key should allow the user to only perform the actions necessary to complete the operation, such as read-only access if the client shouldn't be able to upload data to the data store. For file uploads, it's common to specify a key that provides write-only permission, as well as the location and the validity period. It's critical to accurately specify the resource or the set of resources to which the key applies.</p><p><strong>Consider how to control users’ behavior</strong>. Implementing this pattern means some loss of control over the resources users are granted access to. The level of control that can be exerted is limited by the capabilities of the policies and permissions available for the service or the target data store. For example, it's usually not possible to create a key that limits the size of the data to be written to storage, or the number of times the key can be used to access a file. This can result in huge unexpected costs for data transfer, even when used by the intended client, and might be caused by an error in the code that causes repeated upload or download. To limit the number of times a file can be uploaded, where possible, force the client to notify the application when one operation has completed. For example, some data stores raise events the application code can use to monitor operations and control user behavior. However, it's hard to enforce quotas for individual users in a multi-tenant scenario where the same key is used by all the users from one tenant.</p><p><strong>Validate, and optionally sanitize, all uploaded data</strong>. A malicious user that gains access to the key could upload data designed to compromise the system. Alternatively, authorized users might upload data that's invalid and, when processed, could result in an error or system failure. To protect against this, ensure that all uploaded data is validated and checked for malicious content before use.</p><p><strong>Audit all operations</strong>. Many key-based mechanisms can log operations such as uploads, downloads, and failures. These logs can usually be incorporated into an audit process, and also used for billing if the user is charged based on file size or data volume. Use the logs to detect authentication failures that might be caused by issues with the key provider, or accidental removal of a stored access policy.</p><p><strong>Deliver the key securely</strong>. It can be embedded in a URL that the user activates in a web page, or it can be used in a server redirection operation so that the download occurs automatically. Always use HTTPS to deliver the key over a secure channel.</p><p><strong>Protect sensitive data in transit</strong>. Sensitive data delivered through the application will usually take place using SSL or TLS, and this should be enforced for clients accessing the data store directly.</p><p>Other issues to be aware of when implementing this pattern are:</p><ul><li><p>If the client doesn't, or can't, notify the server of completion of the operation, and the only limit is the expiration period of the key, the application won't be able to perform auditing operations such as counting the number of uploads or downloads, or preventing multiple uploads or downloads.</p></li><li><p>The flexibility of key policies that can be generated might be limited. For example, some mechanisms only allow the use of a timed expiration period. Others aren't able to specify a sufficient granularity of read/write permissions.</p></li><li><p>If the start time for the key or token validity period is specified, ensure that it's a little earlier than the current server time to allow for client clocks that might be slightly out of synchronization. The default, if not specified, is usually the current server time.</p></li><li><p>The URL containing the key will be recorded in server log files. While the key will typically have expired before the log files are used for analysis, ensure that you limit access to them. If log data is transmitted to a monitoring system or stored in another location, consider implementing a delay to prevent leakage of keys until after their validity period has expired.</p></li><li><p>If the client code runs in a web browser, the browser might need to support cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) to enable code that executes within the web browser to access data in a different domain from the one that served the page. Some older browsers and some data stores don't support CORS, and code that runs in these browsers might not be able to use a valet key to provide access to data in a different domain, such as a cloud storage account.</p></li></ul>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><h2>When to use this Pattern</h2></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>This pattern is useful for the following situations:</p><ul><li><p>To minimize resource loading and maximize performance and scalability. Using a valet key doesn't require the resource to be locked, no remote server call is required, there's no limit on the number of valet keys that can be issued, and it avoids a single point of failure resulting from performing the data transfer through the application code. Creating a valet key is typically a simple cryptographic operation of signing a string with a key.</p></li><li><p>To minimize operational cost. Enabling direct access to stores and queues is resource and cost efficient, can result in fewer network round trips, and might allow for a reduction in the number of compute resources required.</p></li><li><p>When clients regularly upload or download data, particularly where there's a large volume or when each operation involves large files.</p></li><li><p>When the application has limited compute resources available, either due to hosting limitations or cost considerations. In this scenario, the pattern is even more helpful if there are many concurrent data uploads or downloads because it relieves the application from handling the data transfer.</p></li><li><p>When the data is stored in a remote data store or a different datacenter. If the application was required to act as a gatekeeper, there might be a charge for the additional bandwidth of transferring the data between datacenters, or across public or private networks between the client and the application, and then between the application and the data store.</p></li></ul><p>This pattern might not be useful in the following situations:</p><ul><li><p>If the application must perform some task on the data before it's stored or before it's sent to the client. For example, if the application needs to perform validation, log access success, or execute a transformation on the data. However, some data stores and clients are able to negotiate and carry out simple transformations such as compression and decompression (for example, a web browser can usually handle GZip formats).</p></li><li><p>If the design of an existing application makes it difficult to incorporate the pattern. Using this pattern typically requires a different architectural approach for delivering and receiving data.</p></li><li><p>If it's necessary to maintain audit trails or control the number of times a data transfer operation is executed, and the valet key mechanism in use doesn't support notifications that the server can use to manage these operations.</p></li><li><p>If it's necessary to limit the size of the data, especially during upload operations. The only solution to this is for the application to check the data size after the operation is complete, or check the size of uploads after a specified period or on a scheduled basis.</p></li></ul>
