                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>
                    You have applied the 
                    <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Microservice architecture pattern</a> and architected your system as a set of services. Each service is deployed as a set of service instances for throughput and availability.
                </p>
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>How are services packaged and deployed?</p>
                <h2>Forces</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Services are written using a variety of languages, frameworks, and framework versions</li>
                    <li>Each service consists of multiple service instances for throughput and availability</li>
                    <li>Service must be independently deployable and scalable</li>
                    <li>Service instances need to be isolated from one another</li>
                    <li>You need to be able to quickly build and deploy a service</li>
                    <li>You need to be able to constrain the resources (CPU and memory) consumed by a service</li>
                    <li>You need to monitor the behavior of each service instance</li>
                    <li>You want deployment to reliable</li>
                    <li>You must deploy the application as cost-effectively as possible</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Run multiple instances of different services on a host (Physical or Virtual machine).</p>
                <p>There are various ways of deploying a service instance on a shared host including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deploy each service instance as a JVM process. For example, a Tomcat or Jetty instances per service instance.</li>
                    <li>Deploy multiple service instances in the same JVM. For example, as web applications or OSGI bundles.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <h2>Resulting Context</h2>
                <p>The benefits of this pattern include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        More efficient resource utilization than the 
                        <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/deployment/single-service-per-host.html" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Service Instance per host pattern</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The drawbacks of this approach include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk of conflicting resource requirements</li>
                    <li>Risk of conflicting dependency versions</li>
                    <li>Difficult to limit the resources consumed by a service instance</li>
                    <li>If multiple services instances are deployed in the same process then its difficult to monitor the resource consumption of each service instance. Its also impossible to isolate each instance</li>
