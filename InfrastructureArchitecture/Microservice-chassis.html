                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>When you start the development of an application you often spend a significant amount of time putting in place the mechanisms to handle cross-cutting concerns. Examples of cross-cutting concern include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Externalized configuration - includes credentials, and network locations of external services such as databases and message brokers</li>
                    <li>Logging - configuring of a logging framework such as log4j or logback</li>
                    <li>Health checks - a url that a monitoring service can “ping” to determine the health of the application</li>
                    <li>Metrics - measurements that provide insight into what the application is doing and how it is performing</li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/distributed-tracing.html" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Distributed tracing</a> - instrument services with code that assigns each external request an unique identifier that is passed between services.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As well as these generic cross-cutting concerns, there are also cross-cutting concerns that are specific to the technologies that an application uses. Applications that use infrastructure services such as databases or a message brokers require boilerplate configuration in order to do that. For example, applications that use a relational database must be configured with a connection pool. Web applications that process HTTP requests also need boilerplate configuration.</p>
                <p>
                    It is common to spend one or two days, sometimes even longer, setting up these mechanisms. If you going to spend months or years developing a monolithic application then the upfront investment in handling cross-cutting concerns is insignificant. The situation is very different, however, if you are developing an application that has the 
                    <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html" style="text-decoration: none;" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">microservice architecture</a>. There are tens or hundreds of services. You will frequently create new services, each of which will only take days or weeks to develop. You cannot afford to spend a few days configuring the mechanisms to handle cross-cutting concerns. What is even worse is that in a microservice architecture there are additional cross-cutting concerns that you have to deal with including service registration and discovery, and circuit breakers for reliably handling partial failure.
                </p>
                <h2>Forces</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating a new microservice should be fast and easy</li>
                    <li>When creating a microservice you must handle cross-cutting concerns such as externalized configuration, logging, health checks, metrics, service registration and discovery, circuit breakers. There are also cross-cutting concerns that are specific to the technologies that the microservices uses.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Build your microservices using a microservice chassis framework, which handles cross-cutting concerns</p>
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <h2>Resulting Context</h2>
                <p>The major benefit of a microservice chassis is that you can quickly and easy get started with developing a microservice.</p>
                <p>You need a microservice chassis for each programming language/framework that you want to use. This can be an obstacle to adopting a new programming language or framework.</p>
