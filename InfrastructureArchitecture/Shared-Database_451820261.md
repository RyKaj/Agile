Context
-------


 {.panelContent}
Let's imagine you are developing an online store application using
the [Microservice architecture
pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html).
Most services need to persist data in some kind of database. For
example, the `Order Service`{.highlighter-rouge} stores information
about orders and the `Customer Service`{.highlighter-rouge} stores
information about customers.

What's the database architecture in a microservices application?

Forces
------


 {.panelContent}
-   Services must be loosely coupled so that they can be developed,
    deployed and scaled independently

-   Some business transactions must enforce invariants that span
    multiple services. For example,
    the `Place Order`{.highlighter-rouge} use case must verify that a
    new Order will not exceed the customer's credit limit. Other
    business transactions, must update data owned by multiple services.

-   Some business transactions need to query data that is owned by
    multiple services. For example,
    the `View Available Credit`{.highlighter-rouge} use must query the
    Customer to find the `creditLimit`{.highlighter-rouge} and Orders to
    calculate the total amount of the open orders.

-   Some queries must join data that is owned by multiple services. For
    example, finding customers in a particular region and their recent
    orders requires a join between customers and orders.

-   Databases must sometimes be replicated and sharded in order to
    scale. See the [Scale
    Cube](https://microservices.io/articles/scalecube.html).

-   Different services have different data storage requirements. For
    some services, a relational database is the best choice. Other
    services might need a NoSQL database such as MongoDB, which is good
    at storing complex, unstructured data, or Neo4J, which is designed
    to efficiently store and query graph data.

Solution
--------


 {.panelContent}
Use a (single) database that is shared by multiple services. Each
service freely accesses data owned by other services using local ACID
transactions.

The benefits of this pattern are:

-   A developer uses familiar and straightforward ACID transactions to
    enforce data consistency
-   A single database is simpler to operate

The drawbacks of this pattern are:

-   Development time coupling - a developer working on, for example,
    the `OrderService`{.highlighter-rouge} will need to coordinate
    schema changes with the developers of other services that access the
    same tables. This coupling and additional coordination will slow
    down development.

-   Runtime coupling - because all services access the same database
    they can potentially interfere with one another. For example, if
    long running `CustomerService`{.highlighter-rouge} transaction holds
    a lock on the `ORDER`{.highlighter-rouge} table then
    the `OrderService`{.highlighter-rouge} will be blocked.

-   Single database might not satisfy the data storage and access
    requirements of all services.
