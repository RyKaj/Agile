Agile : Demo 
============

So at the end of each sprint, a sprint review meeting is held. During this meeting, the Scrum team shows what they accomplished during the sprint. Typically this takes the form of a demo of the new features.

The sprint review meeting is intentionally kept very informal, typically with rules forbidding the use of PowerPoint slides and allowing no more than two hours of preparation time for the meeting. A sprint review meeting should not become a distraction or significant detour for the team; rather, it should be a natural result of the sprint.

Participants in the sprint review typically include:

-   Product Owner
-   Development team
-   Scrum Master
-   Management
-   Customers
-   Developers from other projects

During the sprint review, the project is assessed against the sprint goal determined during the sprint planning meeting. Ideally, the team has completed each product backlog item brought into the sprint, but it\'s more important that they achieve the overall goal of the sprint.

The goal of the meeting is to create visibility around what occurred in the course of the iteration and to amplify learning about what could then be planned for the next iteration. The delivery team presents the done items in a demonstration. Done items are all items that have been accepted by the product owner. The demonstration invites clarification, reflection, and celebration with regard to the team\'s commitment.

The meeting also invites inspection of the metrics that show what occurred in accepting (or not accepting) items. The attendees evaluate:

-   Items were not completed
-   Risks encountered
-   Items more complex than originally planned
-   Tests run, passed, or failed
-   Defects logged
-   Other measurements the team tracked

The product owner and stakeholders use this meeting to evaluate the product and release backlog priorities:

-   Has one item been too costly to complete given its estimated value?     Should like items be re-evaluated?
-   Is another item now not worth working on at all?
-   Should priorities shift higher for some items in the release backlog     based this findings in this meeting?
-   Should we re-allocate team resources based on the done items and     metrics?
-   Are there new items we need to add to the backlog?
-   Should the team stop work entirely on the product based on what we     have just learned?

At the end of a good meeting, all attendees have a clear understanding of the completed iteration as well as a good sense of the value that was delivered. With this information, the product owner continues work on value definition in the form of backlog priorities and details. The team continues its work by taking the learning and applying it to the next iteration planning meeting. The scrum master collects action items and ensures each has an owner. The scrum master then takes on the ownership of ensuring each action item is completed.
