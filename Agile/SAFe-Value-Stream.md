Information Technology : SAFe Value Stream 
==========================================




Value Streams represent the series of steps that an organization uses to
build Solutions that provide a continuous flow of value to a customer. A
SAFe portfolio consists of a set of development value streams, each of
which builds and supports one or more solutions. The primary role of a
SAFe portfolio is to fund and nurture a set of development value
streams. These value streams either deliver end-user value directly or
support internal business processes. Organizing around value streams
offers substantial benefits to the organization, including faster
learning, shorter time-to-market, higher quality, higher productivity,
and leaner budgeting mechanisms.  In SAFe, organizing around value is
accomplished by first understanding value streams and then launching
Agile Release Trains or Solution Trains to fulfill them. Realizing value
streams via trains is the 'art' and science of SAFe. Furthermore, value
stream mapping can be used to identify and address delays and
non-value-added activities to accomplish the Lean-Agile goal of the
shortest sustainable lead time.

-   The Value Stream Level is optional in SAFe.
-   Value Stream Level is new in SAFe 4.0.
-   The Value Stream Level is intended/designed for Enterprises
    /builders/organization who are:

1.  1.  1.  Large in size
        2.  Independent
        3.  Have complex solutions
        4.  Their solutions typically require multiple ARTs
        5.  They have Suppliers contribution.
        6.  They face the largest systems challenges
        7.  For cyber-physical systems
        8.  For software, hardware, electrical and electronics, optics,
            mechanics, fluidics and more.

-   Building this kind of systems often takes hundreds, even thousands
    of practitioners, external and internal suppliers.
-   If the systems are mission crucial. Failure of the Solution, or even
    a subsystem, has unacceptable economic and social consequences.
-   If the Enterprises can be built with a few hundred practitioners, it
    may not need the constructs of this level. In that case, they can
    use from the \'**collapsed view**\' which is 3-level SAFe.
-   Building value stream solutions in a Lean-Agile pattern requires
    additional artifacts, coordination, and constructs. So this level
    contains an Economic Framework to provide financial boundaries for
    Value Stream
-   It supports cadence and synchronization for multiple ARTs and
    Suppliers. It includes Pre-and Post-PI Planning meetings and
    Solution Demo.
-   It gives additional roles which are: Value Stream Engineer, Solution
    Architect/Engineering, and Solution Management.
