Agile : Daily Standup 
=====================


The practice of the daily stand-up not only provides a forum for regular status updates, but brings problems immediately into focus for quick action. It\'s this fast feedback that helps the teams react to change successfully, and makes it imperative that the daily stand-up be one of the first essential routines that any Agile team establish, regardless of office locations.

-   Daily status meeting that lasts 15 minutes or less
-   Uses three key questions to create commitment and remove blocks
    -   What I did yesterday
    -   What I\'ll do today and
    -   I am blocked by...
-   NO problem solving occurs in the daily stand-up; it is for status only, not discussion
    -   If a team member wants to discuss something, they can propose a discussion for a time in the future

Participants usually stand rather than sit to ensure the meeting is over quickly

Expected Benefits
=================

-   the daily meeting prevents a common failure mode of teams, where in the absence of an explicit occasion to share recent information, some critical knowledge may sometimes "fall through the cracks"
-   regular peer-to-peer sharing of information in a short, focused and energetic meeting also contributes to team cohesion
-   stand-up meetings are [reliably](http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0021-9010.84.2.277) shorter, more pleasant and more effective than sit-down meetings

> Stand-ups are one of the fundamental parts of agile development, and it's often the most misunderstood. Let's be real: stand-ups by themselves don't make your team agile. They aren't about inflating egos or justifying job descriptions. They aren't a time to plan; Sprint planning is for planning. They also aren't the only time to mention blockers. If you're stuck, ask for help!

Common Pitfalls
===============

-   perhaps the most common mistake is to turn the daily meeting into a "status report" with each member reporting progress to the same person (the team's manager, [or the appointed Scrum Master](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum-master/)) -- exchanges in the daily meeting should be on a peer-to-peer basis
-   a second common pitfall is a daily meeting which drags on and on; this is easy to address with a modicum of [facilitation](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/facilitation/) skills
-   a third common issue is a team finding little value in the daily meeting, to the point where people will "forget" to have it unless the Scrum Master or project manager takes the initiative; this often reveals a lukewarm commitment to Agile
-   one final common symptom: the "no problem" meeting, where no team member ever raises obstacles ("impediments" in Scrum parlance), even though the team is manifestly not delivering peak performance; this is sometimes an indication that the corporate culture makes people uncomfortable with discussing difficulties in a group setting.

Who Attends?
============

-   The scrum master, product owner and the delivery team
-   Stakeholders and customers can **observe** and are encouraged to attend, but they **do not participate**
-   The scrum master takes notes on each team member\'s obstacles
