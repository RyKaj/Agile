Agile : Backlog Refinement Meeting 
==================================

The last type of Scrum meetings is the backlog refinement meeting, also known as the product backlog grooming. Mostly, product backlog items need refinement for the next Sprint, to make the team understand them better for successful execution.

In backlog refinement meeting, the backlog items are categorized and prioritized after a technical discussion with the team to make sure that the team understands what exactly are the deliverables and what are the requirements.

Conducting backlog refinement meeting reduces the need for a long Sprint planning meeting and gives the team a chance to reflect on the backlog items before fully committing to the Sprint goals.
