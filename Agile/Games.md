Agile Values Puzzle
-------------------

1.  ### Material & Equipment 

2.  ### Objective 

-   [Agile Value Cards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j__hNNxdkz4CON9Bgq5JqlkV17W9zyj3PrMQck_KorE/edit)
    [![](rest/documentConversion/latest/conversion/thumbnail/451826976/1)](/download/attachments/451826901/Agile%20Value%20cards.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1568912013793&api=v2)
-   [Twelve Agile Principles Cards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16OGdiy8QwFveSdzJyhF8CrFr9gdiHU3Lze613909oXo/edit) 
-   I like to print them in A4 colored pages so one can put them in a board and they are visible and readable by all attendees.
-   To let participants learn and discover about agile values and principles in fully interactive and participative mode, without presentations, minimal facilitation, full debate and fun.

### Instructions

#### Connection - What do you know about agile? 

It is good to start asking to participants what they think agile is and
what is not.

Write everything they say in two columns ("Agile is", "Agile is not")
without questioning or arguing any response. This is just to capture
what they "think" agile is.

#### Concept -- Clean up answers 

After adding all entries, ask if any entry should be removed or someone
disagree, discuss with the group and strikethrough the ones that are
incorrect.

#### Concrete Practice - Agile Values Puzzle game 

1.  **No Manifesto** **yet**: Do not mention anything about the agile manifesto, values or principles.
2.  **Groups**: Tell the attendees to split into 2 to 4 groups of about
    2 to 6 persons. Do not say how, just let them auto organize.
3.  **Agile Values**:
    1.  Provide a set of the  [**Agile value cards**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j__hNNxdkz4CON9Bgq5JqlkV17W9zyj3PrMQck_KorE/) to each group
    2.  Directions:
        1.  Four pairs of concepts: Tell the participants to organize the cards into 4 pairs, where each pair should be two concepts that are contradictory on their own but complementary at the same time when they are together.
        2.  More value: For each pair of concepts, tell the participants to select the concept that they think is more important in a scenario where you could only pick one and just one. Put the most valuable concept on the left.
        3.  If at any steps a group is confused, do not give answers, tell them to consult to another group. Clarify the directions of the exercise if needed.
    3.  Values Wall: Tell to each group to
        1.  Pick one pair and stand up and show the cards to the other groups. They must pick a pair that no other group has picked.
        2.  Explain to the other groups their selection and decision.
        3.  If other groups do not agree or the selection is not aligned to the agile manifesto, facilitate discussion until they agree.
        4.  If the other groups agree with their selection, they can put the cards on a wall with tape. The concept with most value should be on the left.
        5.  Repeat until 4 different unique pairs of concepts are in the wall totally aligned with the  [agile manifesto values](http://agilemanifesto.org/) page <http://agilemanifesto.org/> . It should look like this: ![No alt text provided for this  image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQG9bgjmBm0AWQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1574294400&v=beta&t=xwvdtLsDeqiYkoBS1zBUNMfUA3KkgSWsLC6m5J7RUzA)
4.  **Agile Manifesto**: Explain that what they have built intuitively is the Agile Manifesto and these are the four values "That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more." who are the signers, history and whatever else you want.
    1.  Dot voting -- Most important / most difficult: You can also ask for dot voting on which value is the most important value and which one is the most difficult and discuss why.
5.  **Agile Principles**: Provide about 6 to 12  [**agile principle cards**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16OGdiy8QwFveSdzJyhF8CrFr9gdiHU3Lze613909oXo/edit) to each group and tell them that they are the twelve principles of the agile manifesto.
    1.  Principles mapping to values: Tell each group to
    2.  Discuss all the principles for 4 minutes and decide to which of the values each of them match better.
    3.  Stand up with one principle, read it to all groups, say to which value they map it and put it in the row aligned to that value (this is totally subjective, there is no official mapping of principles to any value, it is just a memory and discussion game).
    4.  Ask to other groups if they would like to add anything.
    5.  Repeat until all the 12 principles are in the wall with the values. It should look something like this:

Ball Point
----------

1.  ### Material & Equipment 

2.  ### Objective 

-   A great game for introducing Scrum to new agile teams.
-   The point of this game is to pass as many balls as possible through
    every team member in 2 minutes. The team gets a point for each ball
    passed through every member of the team provided that the first
    person to touch that ball is also the last. There are 5 iterations.
    Before each iteration the team estimates how many they think they
    will pass. At the end of each iteration the actual number passed is
    recorded.

### Instructions

1.  Provide an overview of the game and the rules.
    1.  Everyone is part of one big team.
    2.  Each ball must have air-time.
    3.  Each ball must be touched at least once by every team member.
    4.  Balls cannot be passed to your direct neighbour to your immediate left or right.
    5.  Each ball must return to the same person who introduced it into the system.
    6.  There are a total of five iterations.
2.  Allow the team two minutes of preparation time to determine how they will organize themselves.
3.  Get an estimate from the team of how many balls they can pass through the system.
4.  Run a two-minute iteration.
5.  Allow the team one minute to discuss how to improve the process.
6.  Repeat for five iterations. Make the fifth iteration a challenge. If you need to, make up some ridiculous statistic such as "The world record is 150 points. Can you beat that?"

1.  Conclusion 
    ----------

We noticed these things from the experience of writing tests:

1.  What to do is vague.
2.  Developers tend to embellish.
3.  Tests teach developers, but it's a challenge to pick the right level.
4.  It's hard to turn descriptions into tests.
5.  Tests (and collaboration) can help you discover new things.
6.  The idea of a GUI became actions on a model (for the test).
7.  Customers should come in prepared.
8.  We need many questioners per answerer.
9.  Someone came in late, and found that the examples helped them understand.

1.  ### Topics 

In small groups, we explored these topics:

1.  Sufficient coverage: How do you know you're done -- what's sufficient coverage?
2.  Test styles: What is the relationship between example-based specifications and other styles of tests?
3.  Product Owner: Techniques for interviewing product owners

*Sufficient Coverage*

1.  When adding tests to a legacy system, how much do you \"backfill\"?
2.  Should we just use \"change detector\" tests (record what the system currently does, knowing that it may change later, and may not even be correct).
3.  Do we need all combinations?
4.  Where do we fit example-based tests?

*Test Styles*

We suspected these things about example-based tests:

1.  They may bring about exploratory testing, regression tests, better unit tests, acceptance tests. Load tests?
2.  They provide a concise account of an edge case.
3.  They serve to train new developers in a domain.
4.  They provoke a certain style of conversation.
5.  They may overwhelm developers with distracting detail (no \"metaphor\").
6.  Alternatively, developers may ignore examples! It happens...

*Product Owner*

1.  Use Sophie's Rule -- keep asking \"why?\"
2.  Ask the end goal, define the business problem, define acceptance criteria
3.  Discuss requirements \"as if you were blind\" (without reference to UI)
4.  Need a customer who is is readily accessible
5.  Helps to talk to end users
6.  Programmers need to understand the domain
7.  Let product owners ramble

### Material & Equipment 

-   The [slideset](https://www.agile42.com/documents/28/agile42_Kanban_Pizza_Game.pdf) follows the game from the beginning to the end
-   Make sure you have adequate materials! See the list at the end of this page
-   There should be at least four persons per team
-   The game can be played with one team, but is more fun with more teams and a little healthy competition
-   (OPTIONAL) If there\'s an uneven number of people, consider asking somebody to act as an observer, perform quality assurance and measure lead time
-   Post-Its in three colors: yellow (pineapple), pink (ham\*) and green (rucola i.e. rocket salad)
-   Printer paper to cut pizza bottoms from (A4/Letter works fine but you can also use other sizes)
-   Red markers as tomato sauce
-   Glue or transparent tape (to make the Post-Its stick better)
-   Masking tape (aka. painter\'s tape)
-   Scissors (one small + one large per team)
-   Stopwatch
-   [Order cards](https://www.agile42.com/documents/29/Pizza_Orders.pdf) - one set per team
-   [Oven plate](https://www.agile42.com/documents/30/Pizza_Oven.pdf) - one per team
-   The [Kanban Pizza Game slides](https://www.agile42.com/documents/28/agile42_Kanban_Pizza_Game.pdf)
-   Rule Sheets
-   Kanban Overview Sheets

### Objective 

If you want to understand what Kanban is and practice some Lean concepts
in a safe environment outside of your daily work, then the Kanban Pizza
Game is for you! We start our Kanban trainings with this game, in order
to introduce the whole method and its principles and practices in one
tight package. Software development teams and process development teams
use this game to get acquainted with Kanban.

The game has been designed for a half-day workshop. It takes at least
one hour at the bare minimum, if you rush through the principles and
practices and don\'t wrap up much at the end. Two hours is enough to
cover the theory adequately and allow for reflecting and summarizing.

What are the goals of the game from a training perspective? We want
participants to:

1.  Experience how a Kanban system emerges from an existing process, as
    it does in the real world
2.  Experience a whole Kanban system, as opposed to focusing only on the
    Kanban board and related mechanics
3.  Understand that boards are context-dependent: for any given process
    there are many different board designs that are adequate and useful,
    but the perfect board doesn\'t necessarily exist
4.  Understand the effects of limiting your Work in Progress
5.  Experience self-organization and adaptation
6.  Have fun!

Each team gets paper of different colors, scissors and other materials
(the full list of materials is at the bottom of this page). They will
cut, shape and tape these together to form pizza slices according to the
given recipe.

1.  ### Instructions

2.  ### Create an implicit process

Kanban always starts where you are, from an existing process. At the
start of the game we let the teams to get to grips with the paper pieces
and constraints by building as many pizza slices (Hawaiian) as possible.

Present a ready-made slice of Hawaiian pizza to the teams and explain
what goes into the pizza: a slice of pizza base (paper triangle), tomato
sauce (red marker), three slices of ham (pink Post-Its) and three slices
of pineapple (yellow Post-Its). The tomato sauce covers the pizza bottom
nicely and the toppings are carefully cut and distributed evenly across
the pizza. Yum!

Show the oven plate and explain how it works. There can be a maximum of
three pizza slices in the oven at one time. Cooking time is at least 30
seconds. No adding or removing of slices while baking!

Then ask the teams to produce as many pizzas as they can while trying to
avoid waste i.e. raw materials prepared but not used. When you decide
that time's up (after 5-7 minutes or so) clap your hands and tell them
to stop.

1.  ### Introduce Kanban

At the end of the initial round, introduce Kanban and the core practices
of Kanban:

1.  Visualize the Workflow
2.  Limit your Work in Progress (WIP)
3.  Manage the Flow
4.  Implement Feedback Loops
5.  Make Process Policies Explicit
6.  Improve Collaboratively

These principles are going to be used throughout the game.

Next, explain the scoring system and let each team calculate their
score. The scoring system is designed to promote limiting the WIP and
also serves as an indirect measure of flow (in our case, it correlates
with the lead time as long as people don't know the exact length of the
round, and thereby produces the same behavior). Collect the scores and
write them down in a matrix (teams vs. rounds) on a whiteboard or flip
chart. At this point you can also ask the teams to pick names for their
pizzerias.

Ask the teams to visualize the workflow and make the process explicit by
introducing storage for production materials (pizza bottoms, slices of
ham etc.) directly on the table. Don\'t try to optimize the workflow
now, just document it as it emerged during the first round. The teams
can use the materials at hand, e.g. painter\'s tape (masking tape),
post-its, paper and so on.

Ask the teams to limit their work in progress. Did they have materials
piling up and becoming waste at the end of the round? What would be a
sensible WIP limit for that step and for the other steps?

How about the pizza quality? Did the teams cut corners (perhaps
literally)? Pizza bottoms should be the same size and well covered with
tomato sauce, and the toppings should be nicely cut and distributed
evenly. Ask each team to bring forward their best pizza(s). Then ask the
room to choose the most beautiful specimen. This will become
the Reference Pizza and should be put in a prominent and visible place.

Before the next round, ask the teams to throw away the half-baked
and delivered pizzas, but keep the unused raw materials for the next
round.

1.  ### Second round with established Kanban system 

Now run a new one round with your newly established Kanban system.
Again, don't give any indications of when the round will end, just end
it when you feel like it\'s a good moment in time (after 5-7 minutes).
At the end of the round run a debrief and count the points.

1.  ### Third round, extending the system 

Make the game a bit more complex by introducing the new Pizza Rucola
recipe and the concept of customer orders.

1.  Pizza Rucola contains only tomato sauce and seven pieces of rocket
    salad (green Post-Its). There\'s no ham and no pineapple.
    Unfortunately rocket salad burns easily and must therefore be added 
    *after* the pizza has been taken out from the oven.
2.  Orders can contain several pizzas of two different kinds, and the
    team gets points only when the whole order is fulfilled and
    delivered. Establish a central place where teams can pick up new
    orders and deliver fulfilled orders. Teams can pull several orders
    at once, but not so many that it affects other teams.

When you have presented the extensions to the game and answered any
questions the teams may have, allow the teams five minutes to discuss
and extend their system to account for Pizza Rucola and the orders.

Run the third round. Debrief, measure the points.

1.  ### Fourth and final round

Allow the teams some minutes to discuss and improve their system. Tell
them to play around with the workflow and try different WIP limits.

Run the fourth round. Debrief, measure the points.

1.  ### From the game to a real Kanban Board 

The final step in the game is to visualize the process that is currently
drawn on the tables with painter's tape, and create something that is
closer to a real Kanban board.

Ask the teams to look back on the game, draw the flow on a flipchart or
whiteboard (including WIP limits) and make it look nice using paper
materials and pizzas produced during the game.

1.  Conclusion 
    ----------

Having the experience of the Pizza Game in fresh memory and some nice
Kanban boards on display, it's now really easy to anchor the Kanban
practices.

1.  #### Visualize the workflow 

With the physical production of the Pizza the workflow is always
present, and by drawing the workflow we create a model that we can use
for reflecting on the current process. Remember: all models are wrong,
but some are useful. The workflow is a simplification and can never
match reality perfectly, but it allows us to study and understand our
work.

Note that the workflow can be represented in multiple ways. The fact
that some pizzas go into the oven with toppings and some without can be
described using tags, swimlanes, non-linear workflows, directed
networks, cadences (alternating between hawaii and rucola in the oven)
or a number of other methods.

Over the course of the game, each team created a workflow that made
sense in their own context of people, resources and bottlenecks. While
it is likely that other teams could pick up a board and make it their
own, it doesn\'t mean that any one of the boards is necessarily \"more
right\" than the others.

1.  #### Limit WIP 

Throughout the game, the built-in bottlenecks caused queues to pile up.
This is intentional. During the game the teams introduced limits on the
work in progress (WiP) to make sure that they produce the right things
and to avoid losing points for unused materials. The participants
experienced that WiP limits are more than simple limitations: they drive
and change the behavior of people. People tend to interact more on the
overall production, communicate more and help each other when needed.

1.  #### Manage flow 

Kanban works best when work is flowing nicely through the system.
Normally you would increase the flow by measuring and minimizing the
lead time. Unfortunately this takes too much time away from the
facilitator, and so in the Pizza Game we use a scoring system that is
set up to penalize inventory and trigger similar flow-optimizing
behavior.

In the first rounds of the game there is a tendency to prepare small
stockpiles of materials in advance. In later rounds the team learns to
keep inventory down and maintain flow by tightening the WIP limits.

Measuring the flow in the Pizza Game can be very instructive, but you
will need a co-facilitator to do this.

1.  #### Make process policies explicit

After the first round, each team documented their workflow by marking it
on the table. Any changes to the system were made immediately on the
table. We also set a common quality standard by selecting a Reference
Pizza. How did this help the work? How about roles? Did people have
clear roles? How did they appear? Who allocated the \"resources\" in
this simulation?

1.  #### Implement feedback loops 

What did we collect feedback on? Ask the teams to think for a moment
about what kinds of feedback loops there were in the game, and write
these on post-its. You can either collect all post-its on a board, or
ask people to give examples. During the debrief, ask them what would
have happened without each specific type of feedback.

1.  #### Improve collaboratively and experimentally

The game consisted of four rounds, with time for inspecting and adapting
in between. What would have happened without the possibility to inspect
and adapt? Who did the inspecting and adapting? What information was it
based on? What did people in the tables talk about during pizza
production?

1.  #### Other things worth considering: 

2.  The physical environment: Did the original table arrangement affect
    the initial workflow? The way the workflow evolved?

3.  Group dynamics: How did the different team members participate in
    design of the workflow?

Story Maps
==========

Template
--------

1.  Material & Equipment 
    --------------------

2.  Objective 
    ---------

Giving people an idea about what a Story map is and how it can be used
to facilitate prioritization, release planning and finding MMF's

1.  Instructions 
    ------------

To describe what a story map is. Then I roughly do it this way (You
might want to twist the "story" a bit. The one below is just the basic
version).

Divide people into groups of 5-8 and hand each team these user stories
and vision.

Draw the following backbone on a whiteboard -- one for each team.

1.  Log ind
2.  See available appointments
3.  Book appointment
4.  Confirm
5.  Change
6.  Remind
7.  Admin.

**Story**: Tell them they are both hairdressers trying to set up a
business in a small town and will be competing for the same customers as
well as against existing hairdressers. Market research shows that this
particular town is filled with young people eager to have a more
flexible\
and easy way of booking hairdresser appointments and that given the
opportunity to do this online, whenever they want, they would turn away
from their prior hairdresser. It does however have to very quick and
intuitive for them to make this transition.

Time to market is key and the first hairdresser on the market with an
online solution that customers accept will likely survive while the
other will go bankrupt within a very short while.

**Timeline**: Give them 10 minutes to go through the user stories and
place them in the "right" column on the backbone (there is no right or
wrong). Then allow 20-25 min. to find the "Walking Skeleton" and the
content of the next 2-3 subsequent releases.

The winning team will be the one that can offer the most convincing
story on why they chose to balance functionality and time-to-market the
way they did. Having a theme/vision for each release will give them
extra points but of course the most important thing is their story and
the arguments they use to explain why their release plan is the best
one.

Multitask
=========

Name Game
---------

1.  ### Material & Equipment 

2.  Sheets of paper or cardboard name cards, one per person

3.  Sharpies/pen, at least one per 5-8 person table

4.  ### Objective

Create a name card (first name only) for each participant

1.  ### Instructions 

2.  ### Round One 

3.  Choose a Worker at each table; everyone else will be a Customer.

4.  Customers will each time how long it takes the Worker to write down
    their names.

5.  Begin the exercise: All Customers begin shouting their names at the
    Worker, who starts writing them down, one per card.

6.  The exercise ends when all names have been recorded. Note the best
    and worst times.

7.  #### Round One Debrief 

8.  Note the chaos that likely ensued. This closely parallels the way
    prioritization works at many companies (e.g. the squeakiest wheel
    gets the grease).

9.  Ask a Worker how they felt. They probably were stressed, distracted
    and frustrated.

10. Write the best and worst completion times somewhere visible. We'll
    compare these results to those in succeeding rounds.

11. #### Round Two (\"Everyone\'s Happy?\") Instructions 

12. The Worker, Customers and Goal remain the same.

13. The Worker will write each person's name one letter at a time in a
    round robin fashion. \
    *Example*: If Anna, Bill and Joey are on the team, the Worker would
    write "A" on one sheet of paper, then "B" on another, and "J" on the
    last. Then they would revisit those sheets to write "n," "I" and "o"
    (the second letters in each name), continuing until all names are
    complete.

14. #### Round Two Debrief 

15. Note how things were now orderly, but very inefficient, and ask why.
    Several forms of waste are occurring here, but most notably context
    and task switching. There is also motion waste (moving from one card
    to the next), transportation waste (moving the cards themselves),
    and waiting (the time between actual writing), all of which impact
    throughput of completed work.

16. Ask Customers how they felt. By servicing all customers at once, we
    serve none of them well. Compare this round's times to the last.

17. Ask Workers how they felt. This round was likely frustrating in a
    different way; while the process was orderly, a sense of true
    closure and productivity was likely missing. A great deal of working
    was happening, but little work was getting done.

18. #### Round Three ("Focus") Instructions 

19. The Worker, Customers and Goal remain the same.

20. The Worker chooses the order of Customers to service

21. The Worker writes each Customer's name in its entirety before moving
    on to the next.

22. #### Round Three Debrief

23. Ask Customers how they felt. How was this time different from the
    previous rounds? Was the capacity clearer? Did you feel a need to
    fight for the top spot? Compare the results; they should be at least
    twice as quick as the previous rounds, and possibly several times.

24. Ask Workers how they felt. This approach is by far the best
    controlled, least stressful and easiest to manage.

25. Could this work even better? One thing we could do to make this more
    "agile" is prioritization by value, which could start a conversation
    about Product Owners, if desired.

26. ### Conclusion 

In summary, **the human brain does not multitask**. Focusing on a single
job at a time yields better quality, faster delivery, happier customers
and less wasted time. This factor becomes vastly more critical when
dealing with teams of people and the attendant destructive interference
from so many simultaneous possible interactions.

This lesson has substantial implications at all levels from individual
task management to project portfolio management and resource allocation
systems, and is fundamental to lean-inspired methods such as Kanban.
This concludes our third entry on Agile games. Once again, let us know
if there's a particular lesson you'd like your teams to learn, and we'll
see if we know an exercise to demonstrate it.

Three Little Pigs
-----------------

1.  Material & Equipment 
    --------------------

2.  paper and pen

3.  Objective 
    ---------

Will be comparing the effects of divided attention versus focused
attention.

1.  ### Instructions 




1.  ### Round 1 

You will attend to two different cognitive tasks.

**Task 1**: For the first task, grab a sheet of paper and a pen. You
will be writing a story. Your story can be about anything: How your day
was, "The Three Little Pigs," anything.  *Allow students to set up
materials*.

**Task 2**: While performing task one, you will have another simple
task: Count backwards in increments of "1" from 200 to 1.  *200, 199,
198. *And, do so  ***out loud*** .

*As students are performing this set of tasks, time them to see how much
they accomplished in 4 minutes.*

At the end of round 1, jot down what number you ended at and how many
words you wrote.

1.  ### Round 2 

You will attend to one task at a time. You will spend two minutes on
task one. Then, I will announce for you to switch and spend two minutes
on task 2.

**Task 1**: You will once again write a story. Please make your story
about something different than in round 1.

**Task 2**: Count backwards from 200.

After 4 minutes, jot down how many words you wrote in task one and the
number on which you ended your count. Discuss your findings!

Hands, Numbers, Song
--------------------

1.  ### Material & Equipment 

2.  6-20 people (note - if you have more than this, just split into
    multiple groups. In theory you can handle as many people as you have
    space for)

3.  One facilitator

4.  One stop watch

5.  White board / Easel or equivalent to record a few scores.

6.  ### Objective

7.  ### Instructions

8.  #### Round 1 - Warm-up 

9.  Have each person pair up and then line up in two lines facing each
    other like this:
    1.  A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 (A1 faces B1, A2 faces B2, etc)
    2.  B1 B2 B3 B4 B5
    3.  If you have an uneven number, you can ask one person to be your
        time keeper. If you have some sceptics or others who don't want
        to participate, you can ask them to be observers ;). However,
        you need at least 3 pairs and more is better.

10. Have each pair practice the Hands activity as below

11. Now switch pairs by having everyone in line A move one spot. A5 will
    have to move all the way to A1. Your line should now look like this:
    1.  A5 A1 A2 A3 A4 (A5 is paired with B1, etc)
    2.  B1 B2 B3 B4 B5

12. Have each new pair practice the Numbers activity below

13. Now switch pairs again by having everyone in line A move one spot.
    You should now look like this:
    1.  A4 A5 A1 A2 A3
    2.  B1 B2 B3 B4 B5

14. Have each new pair practice the Song activity below

15. #### Round 2 



1.  You as the project manager will tell the teams which activity
    (project) to work on.
2.  You will bark out instructions (\"Shout-Driven Develolpment\") and
    they are expected to switch tasks on your command. For each activity
    they need to switch to perform the activity with the pair they
    practiced that activity with. (This will involve a lot of movement.)
3.  When each pair resumes an activity that they have already started
    they must pick up where they previously left off.
4.  Your time keeper should record the time when the whole team (all
    pairs) have finished each activity.
5.  Keep asking the team to task switch every 2-10 seconds (be random!)
    until all pairs have completed the activities.
6.  Record the completed time for each activity.




1.  #### Round 2 




1.  You as the project manager will tell them the priority of the
    activities (projects). You will ask them to complete Hands first,
    Numbers second, and Song third. You ask them to complete each
    activity (project) before starting the next.
2.  Your time keeper should record the time when the whole team (all
    pairs) have finished each activity.
3.  Record the completed time for each activity
4.  Your results should look similar to the results in the image below.
    Note: we played this game twice after adding more people - the
    purple numbers are the results of the second game.




1.  #### Additional Tips and or Alterations

2.  Have the group decide how to rotate partners instead of defining the
    rotation for them.

3.  Run the sequential round first and then the multitasking round.

4.  Have the group choose their own song instead of Happy Birthday.

5.  For larger groups, ask them to put their hands up when they complete
    each \'project\'. This will help the time keeper to understand when
    each project is completed amidst the chaos.

6.  Instead of acting as the project manager, act as the product owner
    who represents three different customers/stakeholders.

Work In Progress (WIP)
======================

Coin Game
---------

1.  ### Material & Equipment 

2.  2 sets of 15 Coins
    1.  5 x \$0.25
    2.  5 x \$0.10
    3.  5 x \$0.05

3.  2 teams of 3+ people. Teams need to be even.

4.  paper and pen

5.  Timer or stop watch

6.  ### Objective 

The worker passes the pieces to the customer. The customer measures the
time that the first piece has to arrive at him and the time that all the
pieces put to arrive to him. Finally, the manager measures the time
taken by the worker to get rid of his pieces.

Each member of the team would represent someone in the SDLC. Ie.. BA,
Developer, Tester, and Stakeholder.

1.  ### Instructions 

Customer would be represented by the organizer or person who is timing
the game.

Give a set of to the first worker in both teams. Instruct everyone that
the objective of this game is to process the coins through the system of
workers.

Worker can only use one hand - usually the non dominate.

Small Group / 1 Team
--------------------

1.  ### Round One 

Workers operate on the full batches i.e. they may only pass coins to the
next worker once they have flipped all 20 coins

1.  ### Round Two 

Workers operate on half of the batches i.e. they may pass a batch of 10
coins to the next worker once they have flipped 10 coins

1.  ### Round Three 

Workers operate on third of batches  i.e. they may pass a batch of 5
coins to the next worker once they have flipped 5 coins

1.  ### Round Four 

Workers operate in batches of 1 i.e. they may pass each coin to the next
worker once they have flipped it

Multiple Teams
--------------

1.  ### Scenario 1 

2.  #### Team 1 - Waterfall

To process the coins. Each coin must be flipped and stacked one at a
time -- and then passed the stack to the next worker in the chain who
will flip and stack one coin at a time. Once the stack have been
processed by the team, they are considered "done".

Workers may only pass the coins once the full batch of coins is
complete.\

1.  #### Team 2 - Agile 
To process the coins. Each coin must be flipped before passing it to the
next member of the team. Once the stack have been processed by the team,
they are considered "done".

1.  ### Scenario 2 

2.  #### Team 1 - Waterfall

To process the coins. Each coin must be flipped and stacked one at a
time -- and then passed the stack to the next worker in the chain who
will flip and stack one coin at a time. Once the stack have been
processed by the team, they are considered "done".

Workers may only pass the coins once the full batch of coins is
complete.

1.  #### Team 2 - Agile 

To process the coins. Each coin must be flipped before passing it to the
next member of the team. Once the stack have been processed by the team,
they are considered "done".

Movie
-----

1.  ### Material & Equipment 

2.  ### Objective

3.  The one experience I know we share is the session we\'re in, but
    using a retrospective on the class sets up an awkward \"meta\" and
    recursive dynamic, as we try to do something and think about doing
    it at the same time.

4.  A class often shares another experience (or set of experiences): the
    projects they\'re working on. Everybody may not be on the same
    project, but even if they are, real projects have real issues, and
    using real issues for an example almost instantly violates safety
    and takes away the *magic circle* aspect where it\'s safe to try new
    behaviors.

5.  ### Instructions 

**Identify a movie as the shared experience**. I\'ve been using  *Star
Wars, Episode IV*, with the part of the movie from the rescue of Leia
until Obi-Wan dies and the protagonists escape. (Sorry if that\'s a
spoiler:)

(I\'m sure other well-known movies would work as well but I haven\'t
tried any; perhaps *The Wizard of Oz* or *The Godfather* or something
more modern?)

It\'s possible a person or two hasn\'t seen the movie; I\'m willing to
take that chance. If I thought the background of the group was so
diverse that a substantial part of the group would not have a shared
movie, I\'d try a different approach.

**Ask people to imagine they were the protagonists**, to recollect for a
moment what happened in the relevant part of the movie.\[A couple times
I tried to show the movie clip in fast-forward. From a technology
standpoint, it was painful. But from the perspective of the simulation,
it\'s a better simulation NOT to show anything. As in real life, people
will have different memories of what happened and different perceptions
of what\'s important.\]

**Use the recalled scenes as the basis for a retrospective**.I like
Esther Derby and Diana Larsen\'s approach in *Agile Retrospectives*, and
I use an abbreviated sample exercise addressing each of their sections.
For example:

A. *Set the stage*: Check-In -- \"In a word or two, what\'s on your
mind?\"

B. *Gather data*: Timeline -- \"Recall the memorable, meaningful, and/or
significant events; write one per sticky note, then put it on the
timeline.\"

C. *Generate Insights -- Patterns and Shifts* -- \"Look for patterns.
What links? What shifts? Which are most important?\". Or perhaps do a
\"Worked Well / Do Differently\" analysis.

D. *Decide What to Do* -- Dot Voting -- Give everybody 3 dots to vote
for what to focus on as a group over the near term. (They can put their
dots on 3 different things, or all on the same one if they feel
strongly.) Agree on the immediate (concrete) next steps, who will lead
them, and how and when progress will be reported.

E. *Close the Retrospective* -- Appreciations -- Identify how others
have contributed. \"Bob, I appreciate you for \_\_\_.\" (\"Thank you.\")

Even doing this in an abbreviated manner (a few minutes for each) lets
you run through a complete retrospective in miniature.

You can then follow it up with some debriefing to bring out any points
you need to make.

Leadership
==========

How Agile Are you
-----------------

1.  ### Material & Equipment 

2.  2-6 players (even though more is possible)

3.  Intended audience is management

4.  Takes 1.5 hours (on average)

5.  Needs a skilled facilitator

6.  ### Objective 

This game has been designed to get discussions on agile leadership going
and to ensure that people start observing behavior that belongs (or does
not belong) to an agile organization. It is specifically intended for
management teams. The game is focused on agile mindset and agile
leadership: what do people and organizations need from management when
engaged in an agile transformation?

1.  ### Outcomes 

2.  Participants need some time to figure out how to play the game and
    how to work with the quadrants on the board.

3.  An ice breaker to start with and a small warm up round increases
    effectiveness and actionable outcome of the game.

4.  Making sure the topics in the discussion round are precisely those
    that matter most to the organisation and the participants, adds
    greatly to the usefulness of the session.

5.  You need a skilled facilitator.




1.  Instructions
    ------------

Participants are asked to very rapidly (! ten seconds per card on
average :) !) divide forty-two cards with 'characteristics' of
organizations, over one of the quadrants on the board. As a participant
you are to decide how the characteristic manifests itself in your
organization at this moment. The game board consists of the quadrants
"LET GO, IGNORE, CREATE and KEEP" as you can see in the image below.

If the characteristic on the card is behavior that the organization DOES
HAVE at that time but that you DON'T WANT, the card gets sorted in the
quadrant "LET GO". If the participant perceives the characteristic on
the card as a behavior the organization DOES HAVE and that you DO WANT,
it ends up at "KEEP" and so on. An example of a characteristic is
"management spends a lot of time putting out fires".

There is no right or wrong: the game provides insight in the current
state of affairs. The characteristics are labelled in types of behavior
belonging to types of organization. So you could end up with lots of
characteristics belonging to agile organizations in the "CREATE"
quadrant. :)

After the time box for sorting the cards ends, the participants will
discuss the characteristics that seem most relevant to them and their
organization. Each participant gets the chance to enter at least one
card/characteristic into the discussion. This needs to be (well)
facilitated by an experienced coach/agile master. You can take as long
as you like for the discussion and could do several discussion rounds,
but we would recommend not to have it last for too long (1.5 hours max).

After the discussion round it is useful to add an extra step in the game
as to make the outcome more actionable: the participants priorities the
top three of characteristics/topics they would like to let go or create.
These are the topics they can start working with the very next day! This
way you also prevent the session being perceived as just fun, irrelevant
and/or without consequences. Because there are forty-two cards in the
game and you won't discuss them all, the game is most suitable to be
played again at a later time -- it won't lose its value.

Generic Questions to ask after each game
========================================

1.  What did you think of the game?
2.  What are some conclusions you can draw about how you are currently
    working?
3.  Notice that in the second attempt you completed all three tasks
    before you completed the first one in the multi-tasking round. What
    do you think about that?
4.  For the two rounds, notice your time to market.
5.  How different was the quality of your product in round one and two?
6.  What did you notice about your stress level in round one and two?
7.  What does this game teach us about sustainable pace?
8.  Describe your discipline level in each round. How much did your team
    cheat or ignore the manager\'s orders?
9.  How does that affect how you will work?
10. What happens when you task switch?
11. What are the costs to juggling tasks?
12. How can we change the way we work to take advantage of this?
13. What are the barriers to making this happen?
14. How can you respond to someone who is asking you to switch to
    another task or to split yourself between two or more projects
