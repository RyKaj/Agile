Information Technology : SAFe Team Level 
========================================



![](https://lm2jj13uhv2157rey3v60xm8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Keystone-TTA-WEB-1.png)

The Team Level contains the roles, activities, events, and processes
which Agile Teams build and deliver value in the context of the Agile
Release Train (ART). Teams are the foundation of SAFe and the Lean
enterprise, as they perform the clear majority of the work that delivers
customer value. SAFe's Team Level describes how to create
high-performing teams that create high-quality components and solutions,
supporting both team agility and technical agility. While depicted
somewhat separately in the 'Big Picture,' the SAFe team level is a vital
part of the Program Level. All SAFe teams are part of an ART---the
primary construct of the program level.

Each agile team is responsible for defining, building, and testing
Stories from their Team Backlog. Using common Iteration cadence and
synchronization, the teams align to a series of fixed-length Iterations
to make sure the entire system is iterating. Teams use ScrumXP or Kanban
to deliver high-quality systems, routinely producing a System Demo every
two weeks. This ensures that all teams in the ART create an integrated
and tested system that stakeholders can evaluate and respond to with
fast feedback.

-   All SAFe teams are part of one or other Agile Release Train (ART).
-   SAFe teams are empowered, self-organizing, self-managing,
    cross-functional teams
-   Each team is equally responsible for defining, building and testing
    stories from their Team Backlog in a fixed-length Iterations
-   Teams plan and execute two-week time-boxed iterations in accordance
    with agreed-to Iteration Goals.
-   Teams will use ScrumXP/Team Kanban routine to deliver high-quality
    systems to produce a System Demo on every two weeks.
-   All different teams in the ART (Agile Release Trains) will create an
    integrated and tested system. Stakeholders will evaluate and respond
    with fast feedback
-   They apply Built-in Quality practices.
-   Each ScrumXP team will have 5-9 team members, which includes all the
    roles necessary to build a quality incremental value in each
    Iteration.
-   ScrumXP roles includes:
    -   Team(Dev+QA)
    -   Scrum Master
    -   Product Owner. Etc..
-   SAFe divides the development timeline into a set of iterations
    within a PI (Program Increment).
-   ~~PI duration is between 8 -12 weeks.~~
-   The team will use stories to deliver the value. The Product Owner
    will have content authority over their creation and acceptance of
    the stories.
-   Stories contain Customer\'s requirements.
-   Team Backlog includes user and enabler stories, which are identified
    during PI planning. When the Product Management presents the
    Roadmap, Vision, and Program Backlog.
-   Identifying, elaborating, prioritizing, scheduling, implementing,
    testing, and accepting the stories are the primary requirements of
    management work in team level.
-   Each iteration provides:
    -   A valuable increment of new functionality
    -   Accomplish via constantly repeating pattern
    -   Plan the iteration
    -   Commit to some functionality
    -   Execute the iteration by building and testing Stories
    -   Demo the new functionality
    -   Retrospective
    -   Repeat for the next iteration
-   Teams also support the System Demo at the end of each Iteration.
    which is the critical integration point for the ART.
-   Larger Value Streams will have multiple ARTs.
-   The Innovation and Planning (IP) Iterations leverage the teams with
    an opportunity for innovation and exploration.
