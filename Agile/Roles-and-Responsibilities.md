Agile : Roles and Responsibilities 
==================================
Roles and responsibilities in the Agile world, and in particular for Scrum, vary drastically between organisations. 

In the early stages of Agile transformation and especially when transitioning from a Waterfall model, Responsibility Assignment Matrices (RAM) and Working Agreements can add significant value to agile processes. These can provide awareness and structure on how responsibility is shared and the expectations for how a group will function together and enhance their self-organization processes.

Traditionally refereed to as a RACI matrix, defining Roles and Responsibilities coupled with a Responsibility Assignment Matrix serve as a "Working Agreement" that helps shape the participation of various organizations, people, and roles in completing tasks or deliverable, and can be used to help clarify roles and responsibilities in a cross-functional team. Working agreements, also known as team norms, are guidelines developed by the teams as to how they must work together to create a positive, productive process.

Both Agile and Scrum frameworks promote a series of principles, concepts and values that depart from the previous paradigms of project management. Based on these these values and principles we can depict implicit agile roles and responsibilities in Scrum.

Scrum encourages transparency, inspection and adaptation. Scrum ceremonies are specifically built to make these values shine. The Daily Scrum is the place where the Scrum Team gets together and learns about the state of the sprint. Everyone is therefore implicitly informed at least once a day.

Scrum is also promoting communication, pro-activity, and courage. You don’t need to be on a list of consulted people. All the team can be consulted, and as a matter of fact, the Daily Scrum is a great place to speak up and provide (short) feedback's to your coworkers when needed.

Using these insights into a Scrum-flavored RACI, we can build a RACI Matrix Template that can be discussed, analysed, debated and finally communicated, in the early formation of the Squads when Working Agreements, Definition of Done, Definition of Ready and so on are being defined.

This section provides best practice and examples of the Roles of Responsibility across Squads, Tribes, Chapters and Guilds and help shape a view of how each member contributes to responsibilities.

<kbd>![What is Scrum Team](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/scrum/how-scrum-team-works/sites/7/2018/12/what-is-a-scrum-team.png)



Coaches
================================================================
- Co-create agile transformation strategy together with tribe leadership and supported by available org assets (e.g. Blueprint, Playbook etc.) 
- Work on Tribe impediments removal and WoW improvements
- Coaching individual tribe leaders (visibility, safe environment etc.)
- Supporting engagement with the upcoming tribes by sharing lessons learned, developed organizational assets and engaging in coaching sessions when appropriate.
- Facilitating information flow between the squads as well as with tribe leadership (SoS)
- Support Product coach and Product organisation in agile transformation
- Single point of contact for T-team and T-Team PO for any tribe related issues
- As other things as needed




Scrum Master (close reference in Waterfall role Project Manager)
================================================================

<kbd>![What is Scrum Master](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/scrum/how-to-become-qualified-scrum-master/sites/7/2018/12/what-is-a-scrum-master.png)

Often considered the coach for the team, the Scrum Master helps the team do their best possible work. This means organizing meetings, dealing with roadblocks and challenges, and working with the Product Owner to ensure the product backlog is ready for the next sprint. The Scrum Master also makes sure the team follows the Scrum process. He or she doesn't have authority over the team members, but he or she does have authority over the process. The scrum master help to keep the team accountable to their commitments to the business and also remove any roadblocks that might impede the team's productivity. They met with the team on a regular basis to review work and deliverables, most often in a weekly cadence. The role of a scrum master is to coach and motivate team member, not enforce rules to them.  The scrum master is the team role responsible for ensuring the team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes and practices that the team agreed they would use.

The responsibilities of this role include:
-   Clearing obstacles
-   Establishing an environment where the team can be effective
-   Addressing team dynamics
-   Ensuring a good relationship between the team and  [product owner](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/product-owner/) as well as others outside the team
-   Protecting the team from outside interruptions and distractions
-   To facilitate daily scrum, sprint planning, sprint demo, and retrospective meeting
-   Resolve conflicts by focusing on scrum values of openness, honesty, and respect
-   Forecast the number of deliverable possible in an iteration based on evidence
-   Estimate and plan for the whole software development project
-   Coach the team in agile practices; emphasize on individuals & interactions over process & tools
-   Help the team members in clarifying goals and actions to achieve the goals
-   Shield the team from any distractions and interference
-   Ensure the correct application of the scrum process
-   Scrum Master serves his team rather than direct the team

The scrum master role was created as part of the Scrum framework.  The name was initially intended to indicate someone who is an expert at [ Scrum ](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum/) and can therefore coach others.

The role does not generally have any actual authority. People filling this role have to lead from a position of influence, often taking a servant-leadership stance.

Scrum master is typically the term used to refer to this role, even by teams not explicitly following Scrum.  Other terms used infrequently include iteration manager, agile coach, or team coach.


Product Manager
=====================================================================
- Understanding and representing user/market needs
- Event horizon: 6 months and above
- Defines and owns product vision, road-map, program backlog, ROI
- Drives objectives and release content
- Monitoring the market and developing competitive analysis.
- Prioritizing product features, capabilities features and enablers
- Owns feature readiness and feature acceptance criteria
- Demonstrates latest iterations to customer/user and gathers feedback
- Partners with multiple Product Owners



Product Owner ( closes reference in Waterfall role Business Analysis)
=====================================================================

As the product owner, you should directly interact with the customers and users, the development team, and other key stakeholders, as the picture below shows.

<kbd>![Product Owner Role in Scrum](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/scrum/what-is-project-owner-role-in-scrum/sites/7/2018/12/product-owner-role-in-scrum.png)

The Product Owner has the vision of what he or she wants to build and conveys that vision to the team. The Product Owner focuses on business and market requirements, prioritizing all the work that needs to be done. He or she builds and manages the backlog, provides guidance on which features to ship next, and interacts with the team and other stakeholders to make sure everyone understands the items in the product backlog. The Product Owner is not a project manager. Instead of managing the status and progress, his or her job is to motivate the team with a goal and vision. The Product Owner is the Team member who knows what the customer  wants and the relative business value of those wants. He or she can then translate the customer's wants and values back to the Scrum team. The Product Owner must know the business case for the product and what features the customers' wants. He must be available to consult with the team to make sure they are correctly implementing the product vision.

The product owner is a role on a product development team responsible for managing the product backlog in order to achieve the desired outcome that a product development team seeks to accomplish.  Key activities to accomplish this include:

-   Clearly identify and describe product backlog items in order to build a shared understanding of the problem and solution with the product development team 
-   Make decisions regarding the priority of product backlog items in order to deliver maximum outcome with minimum output
-   Determine whether a product backlog item was satisfactorily delivered
-   Ensure transparency into the upcoming work of the product development team.

The product owner role was created as part of the Scrum framework in order to address challenges that product development teams had with multiple, conflicting direction, or no direction at all with respect to what to build.

Many infer that a product owner is someone who can spend a considerable amount of time with the product development team providing clarification on product backlog items, and making decisions about which product backlog items to do and regarding the specifics of those particular product backlog items.

The Product Backlog is dynamic and constantly evolves in \"an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items\". This means that the Product Owner and Development team can prioritize the backlog, should have the oversight of Product Owner to ensure the team does not veer to far off course.

Scrum Teams
===========

<kbd>![Traditional team vs Agile team](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/scrum/what-is-self-organizing-team-in-scrum/sites/7/2018/11/traditional-team-vs-agile-teams.png)
<kbd>![Diagram of Scrum roles.](https://uploads.toptal.io/blog/image/127502/toptal-blog-image-1540989863224-88f5589dbe6fb7620b59c7c7dd09ed84.png)

The Scrum Team is comprised of five to seven members. Everyone on the project works together, helps each other, and shares a deep sense of camaraderie. Unlike traditional development teams, there are not distinct  oles like programmer, designer, or tester. Everyone completes the set of work together. The Scrum Team owns the plan for each sprint; they anticipate how much work they can complete in each iteration. 

The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of \"Done\" product at the end of each Sprint. A \"Done\" increment is required at the Sprint Review. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team's overall efficiency and effectiveness.

Development Teams have the following characteristics:
-   They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality; 
-   Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;
-   Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person;
-   Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture,
    operations, or business analysis; and, 
-   Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.


Self-Organizing
===============
Choose how to best accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team

To building a self-organizing team, the organization should ensure that it provides the necessary infrastructure, training, and incentive system to keep employees motivated at work. Creating a self-organizing team can be considered a three-step process

<kbd>![Building a self-organizedteam](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/scrum/what-is-self-organizing-team-in-scrum/sites/7/2018/11/building-a-self-organized-team.png)

Training 
--------
Proper training can help satisfy many of the principles that self-organizing teams require. Specifically, hard skills training can ensure competency and provide the necessary framework to conduct tests that lead to regular improvements. Meanwhile, soft skills training can help lay the groundwork for high levels of communication, collaboration, commitment, and confidence.

Coaching 
--------
Before becoming a true self-organizing team, groups need coaching. They may require more support and guidance at the beginning. These are the indicators of your team getting more and more mature such as: Scrum ceremonies are productive, the team enjoys the work and members help each other, new ideas are forthcoming, and teams are pulling work for themselves. Finally, the role of the coach should diminish over time as team  embers learn how to take ownership and begin to collaborate with and trust one another in a self-organizing way.

Mentoring 
---------
Once a team starts self-organizing, the journey has only just begun.  Assign mentors who can help the team go to the next level, so that the growth of the team will to be sustain in longer run. For example, job rotations can be an important aspect of keeping employees involved and of encouraging continuous learning, as this kind of mentoring could help with continuity by ensuring everyone grows together and remains motivated.

Cross-Functional
================
Have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.

Traditionally, a project is organized around component teams (i.e. UX, Dev, Business, Tester, and ...), any release that requires a range of component expertise will need to involve multiple component teams. Typically, different teams will have different sets of priorities, which inevitably leads to bottlenecks in the product release cycle. 

According to Wikipedia, a cross-functional team is a group of people with different functional expertise working toward a common goal. One of the best ways to improve the quality of your team is to make it cross functional.  A cross functional team has all the necessary skills to turn an idea into a working product.

The [Scrum](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/scrum-in-3-minutes/) Guide indicates "The [Scrum Team](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-is-scrum-team/) consists of a  [Product Owner](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-is-project-owner-role-in-scrum/), the Development Team, and a  [Scrum Master](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-is-scrum-master/). Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. In contrast to the component team approach, a cross functional teams are groups consisting  of people from different functional areas of the company. -- it should be formed not only with technical specialists (Back-end, Front-end developers, QA engineers, etc.), but also consists of member like Business Analysts, Marketing and UX specialists or anyone else taking an active part in the project.

<kbd>![Cross Functional Team in Agile](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/scrum/what-is-cross-functional-team-in-agile/sites/7/2018/12/cross-functional-team-in-agile.png)

Cross functional teams are one of the key ingredients that help make scrum teams successful and productive.  Cross functional teams have more flexibility, can react faster to changing needs, and can better handle ongoing support and maintenance.

According to Mike Cohn, "Perhaps the most prevalent and persistent myth in  [agile](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-is-agile-software-development/) is that a cross-functional team is one on which each person possesses every skill necessary to complete the work. This is simply not true ... A cross-functional team has members with a variety of skills, but that does not mean each member has all of the skills"

In reality, Agile cross functional teams not only means that the team itself is cross functional, but also that each team members can preferably play multiple [roles](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-are-the-three-scrum-roles/) as well.  Being a specialist does not mean a member know one thing at the expense of knowing other things, ideally, the talent profile should be T shaped, in that he / she have depth in one area of expertise, and breadth across other areas.

Enabling Business Agility in a Nutshell -- Free Infographic Poster
------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to create human and flexible organizations for more value
In this poster we cover the combination of the people perspective and the business perspective and how new perspectives and ways of working can enable business agility. Only once these two perspectives are in sync we can truly empower people and build learning organizations that not just handle complexity better -- but even uses it as a business advantage.

To create this poster I have worked with two of the front runners within both of the areas (together with Managers) that most of all have to change to enable Business Agility,  [Bjarte Bogsnes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bjarte-bogsnes-41557910/) within Finance and  [Pia-Maria Thorén](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piamia/) within HR.

### People Perspective -- Theory X and Y

<kbd>![](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/03/theory-x-y.png)

If we have an X view on people we believe they are lazy and don't want to do a good job. They need to be managed and controlled to do their work and have very little creativity. This is reflecting how traditional management processes are set up.

If we have an Y view on people we believe that under the right conditions people like to work and that they are creative. People are motivated when they take ownership and set their own goals. This is a modern management view for the knowledge era of today.

Agile Coaching in a Nutshell
----------------------------

### The content of the Agile Coaching in a Nutshell poster 

#### The Agile Coaching Competency Framework

The framework that I find best describe the complexity of the role in a great way is the  [Agile Coaching Competency Framework](http://agilecoachinginstitute.com/agile-coaching-resources/) by Lyssa Adkins and Michale Spayd at agile Coaching Institute. I have tweaked it a bit  to be able to use it on a broader perspective then within software development. My hope is that it can be used by Agile Coaches across the organization. The way they explain it is that every Agile Coach should master at least one area within the 4 main areas.

[<kbd>![agile coaching competence framework](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-17.58.09.png)](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-17.58.09.png)

#### Choosing a Coaching Stance

This 9 grid is based on the orginal paper from 1985, Principles and Dynamics of Matching Role to Situation. Douglas P. Champion, David H. Kiel and Jean A. McLendon. This one has also been modified to better fit our way of working today when our stances may vary all the way from visionary Agile leaders to hands on experts.

[<kbd>![choosing a coaching stance](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-17.58.58.png)](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-17.58.58.png)

#### Levels of Agile Coaching

This is a description of how we work at different levels in the organization. When we combine our efforts and also work as a team in  paralell -- thats when we can get great results moving forward changing the culture. The most important for all organizations who wants to become Agile is to get leadership across the organization onboard and to support the Agile teams to become high performing by removing hinders continiously, this is often the focus for Enterprise Agile Coaches. Also enabling Business Agility by transforming functions such as finance and HR to support Agility -- strategic process improvement and leading the Agile Coaches group. Agile coaches on teamlevel work with building high performing teams as well as supporting needs in between teams in organizations with several teams. Team facilitators handle the facilitation of the team ceremonies. This is also orinally a model from Lyssa Adkins and Michael Spayd that we have altered too and added the strategic level.

[<kbd>![Levels of Agile Coaching](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-18.00.24.png)](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-18.00.24.png)

#### The Agile Coaches Group

The group of Agile Coaches work individually in their roles within different areas, but also together as a team with shared goals to take a organizational and long term strategic responsibility for improvements. The group is named differently in different frameworks, but the purpose is always the same; to work strategic and operational with process improvements and do coaching, training and mentoring.

[<kbd>![the agile coaching group](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-18.00.17.png)](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-18.00.17.png)

#### Areas of Agile Coaching

In Agile organisations a leader is responsible only in one area. Either PEOPLE, PRODUCT, TECHNOLOGY or PROCESS. Agile coaches coach in the process in all areas to improve value and flow continuously. This is something we both often see as a subject of misunderstanding and fear to many traditional leaders where they previously in their line manager role might have had managing both strategy, people and technology. This does not mean they will loose their job, or become less valuable, it just means they can focus more, become better leaders who are less stressed, enabling the organizational to be more innovative and people friendly.

[<kbd>![areas of agile coaching](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-17.59.29.png)](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-17.59.29.png)

#### Shu-Ha-Ri

This is a classic way to visualize the different levels of Lean Agile maturity on an individual level that I use a lot in my coaching. We often work to get as many as possible up to HA-level, thats when we get a strong foundation for an Agile Mindset in an organization. If too many people stay on SHU-level and the Agile Coaches leave, thats when the organization starts to fall back to previously behaviours and structures.

-   **SHU -- Follow the rules** The student who is starting to learn and practices by the book.
-   ***HA -- Bending the rules***  The practitioner who reflect on Agile values and principles. Can choose when to use what for best result.

***RI -- Is the rule*** The master who adapts and invent emerging practices for new contexts and situations. 

1.  [<kbd>![shu ha ri](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-19.12.13.png)](https://media.dandypeople.com/2019/02/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2019-02-03-kl.-19.12.13.png)

**Some last coaching advice**

-   Listen to understand, not to answer
-   Be tough on the problem, but kind to the people
-   Support those who want support
-   Inspire to change, never use force

At Dandy People we support teams and organizations to become Agile to be able to focus on the business strategies and to mobilize the brain power in the teams to deliver value continuously. We call these value driven Agile teams for " *Lean Teams*" since they own the process end 2 end to deliver value, and that they also own the part of the service or product end 2 end. These teams work hypothesis based and have clear missions for 6-12 months with clear KPIs that gives them mandate to decide what to do when and enables them to have a ongoing learning process -- all which is needed in a fast paced world if you desire to be the leading product or service within your niche. Crucial for these teams are of course the T-shape of the team members. The T-shape is something that enables the team to work as a team and it creates a really strong teams without dependencies to people within the team -- and it also prevents the team to not do mini-waterfall in the team (just doing their part and handing over to the next). You can read more about  [T-shape here and how to grow it as a leader](https://dandypeople.com/blog/t-shaped-employees-and-how-to-grow-it-as-an-agile-leader/). **In this post you can download the poster for free and learn more

##### Lean Teams Connected to the Customer Journey with Missions

<kbd>![The Lean Team](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/11/the-lean-team-on-a-mission.png)

The Lean Teams  *(as in Lean UX and Lean Startup)* are connected to the most important business strategies via the customer journey -- or they take ownership of specific products. These teams will need support from other teams, such as a platform team and support teams who's mission is to support the needs from the Lean Teams and when needed enable self service so the Lean Teams can work as independently as possible delivering fast with high quality. This makes the organization and the teams fast at delivering whats needed, when it´s needed without having to have someone to tell them what to do when. "Lean" in Lean Team also refers to Lean UX and Lean Startup, the team works with both discovery AND delivery end to end to always learn what solutions are needed, with a long term mission, they can stop delivering on one idea when they see a change on connecting KPI´s and move on to the next thing that now is the most important opportunity. This approach creates truly high performing team with all skills needed, that can work really well together in all different parts of the process as well as great product ownership (as in the process).
Many organizations will have to start to transform from a silos based organization to cross functional Lean Teams -- and that journey must start both top down and bottom up. If the leadership (management) don't enable this and start changing the system surrounding the teams, the people in the teams will not be able to do the changes needed.

### User research, Planning and Delivery across the Organization -- connects as never before 

<kbd>![planning](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/11/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2018-11-02-kl.-20.01.43.png)

The Customer Journey Product Organization with Lean Teams is a way to scale an organization to support customer focus, agile mindset and principles -- increasing speed AND value to the max. This type of organization done well, is always on it´s toes to understand and learn about the users needs, experimenting and learning about new behaviors, as well as taking car of existing customers. The Customer Journey organization format is by default well connected with user research methods such as Service Design, Customer Journey Mapping and Design Thinking enabling the teams to align as well keeping the teams autonomous. To plan the work needed  to solve customer pain points found in the user research (in the customer journey) the organization can easily use [User Story Mapping](https://dandypeople.com/blog/lean-kravstallning-av-kungliga-operans-planeringssystem/) to plan all the work needed across the organization in a visual and adaptive way to enable agile sliced deliveries based on customer scenarios. This is the wet dream for any control freak -- so yes, you too should get super exited. No more worries about if the organization is working on the right things. This way of working will save the organization so much work not  having to do any project management, not doing any reports on progress (because that is visual to everyone in the organization on [storysonboard.com)](https://storiesonboard.com/) or doing any estimates with story  points (if the teams don´t want too). Visualization like this gives focus and enables collaboration to solve tricky customer problems in complex technical and restricted domains. If you once have worked like this, I can promise you never wan´t to go back to any other way of working. Here you can download the [Agile User Experience poster](https://dandypeople.com/blog/agile-user-experience-with-a-dash-of-lean-ux-free-poster/ for free for more on this topic.

##### Slicing for Value with User Story Mapping to create Alignment 

The User Scenario is the core in the Customer Journey -- we tell the story of the user. The Scenarios are the base for the planning. All scenarios belong to a role or a persona. This helps to understand the context, as well as to slice for value. The same scenarios are also used as a base for testing.

The Backbone of the User Story Map goes across the timeline. Its the high level process, usually it stays the same year after year, the only thing that changes is the solution in how we serve our customers. 
User Story Mapping is a method created by Jeff Patton. It can be digitzed in [storiesonboard.com](http://storiesonboard.com) and imported slice by slice to Trello or Jira if needed still keeping the big picture intact.

When working like this it´s easy for the team to get an overview of what they are delivering on as a team, but also across teams. Make sure to involve the teams in creating the user story map too so that you can use their brain power in actually solving the user problems and finding the best solutions doing so, then everyone knows why they are doing what and for who, and they can all help out to make smart tactical and operational decisions.

##### The different type of teams 

<kbd>![Different type of teams in a customer journey organization](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/11/customer-journey-org-teams.png)

-   **Customer Journey Teams** -- Delivers on Strategies connected to the customer journey, such as Increasing New Customers, LTV or Increased Usage.
-   **Product Teams** -- Delivers on Strategies connected to specific products & maintain the platform for long term high quality & speed.
-   **Platform Teams** -- Platform Teams delivers functionality in the platform to support needs from the Customer Journey -- & Product Teams.
-   **Support Teams** -- Support Teams acts to deliver self service for all other teams. Could also coach, train, mentor and support in alignment and strategic input.

##### Cross-functional competences is needed in the Lean Team 

<kbd>![cross functional lean teams](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/11/Ska%CC%88rmavbild-2018-11-02-kl.-20.01.23.png)

The competences needed in a Lean Team is based on what Mission the team has. It will differ from team to team, and from organization to organization. Compared with a traditional silos organization, this organization is a matrix organization. It might not even be needed to do a "re-organization" to shift to this organization. Of course you have to change who you sit and work with, but you might could keep the same manager. Managers who take care of the people are preferably put within a "skill".

Since the team in "on a Mission" they need to be really great at team work. Therefore roles and titles are usually removed from the team. What´s is important is to solve the mission together, not who is doing what. This creates the environment for really high performance teams. The roles in a Lean Team (just as in a normal Scrum Team) is the Product Owner, The Scrum Master (yes, you probably still will work in Scrum) and then, all the rest is simply -- the team. The Scrum Master Role might though be a rotating "hat", meaning the team might have several team members that can act as Scrum Master and rotate as they like. Perhaps these teams also might come up with new "hats" or in the future. Since Lean UX and Design Thinking together with facilitation skills will be highly important for these teams, that might also be a "hat" in the team to be able to coach and facilitate these activities in the team.

The Managers job is first of all to take care of the needs of the people and supporting the skill to learn from each other between the teams, gain new knowledge and to remove obstacles for the teams to enable mastery and high performance. The manager in a skill does not need to be expert herself within that area of expertise but rather have a growth mindset, helping people to grow and support them when they need support outside the team. The manager does not have anything to do with WHY, WHAT or HOW the teams do their product development work. Having managers horizontally across teams makes it easier for team members to join new teams, otherwise the employees need to change manager to move between teams, and that usually makes the organization less flexible over time. Also it makes the transformation from a traditional organization more smooth.

The Manager too belong to a team, the Leadership Team, having stand-ups and working to always improve the system in the organization. In the long run though, the role of the Leadership Team can perhaps grow in to a Agile coaching unit that coaches in between teams and supports in removing impediments outside the team. But then there need to be support teams to supporting the full needs of the teams, or the teams take on those tasks as well. You should always view it as an emerging process, start where you are at and work together to create a safe environment, mobilize the brain power in the organization and improve as you go along.

Support Teams 
-------------

If the teams are in need of more support within a specific skill a support team should be created. Such a support teams Mission is to enable self service to the teams, to support in competence development across all  eams and to improve what´s going on "in-between-teams". An example on such a team could be Design Ops.

**Example of a mission for a Design Ops Team**
*"We make it easy for all Teams to see the "big picture" for the customer, to quickly create usable design on all platforms and to support an aligned user experience across teams".*

**Example of ** **activities ** **for a Design ** **Ops Team**

-   Create and update design framework to align the user experience and make it easier for the teams
-   Visualize data and insights from all teams
-   Coach and train all teams and leaders in design activities and skill set if needed
-   Input and support for Strategic Company Bets or to teams when needed

##### Modern Agile and Continuous improvement of the System 

<kbd>![Modern Agile Improvement Flower](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/11/modern-agile-improvement-flower.png)

The values of Modern Agile works really well with this type of customer focused organization and with the way of working in the Lean Teams. Lean teams will not work without the 4 values in place.

Modern Agile together with the Lean Team concept also gives a freshness to the view on Agile that can be needed in many organizations today who might have been struggling with making the Scrum Teams on IT work smoothly with the customer.

At Dandy People we created a visualization around Modern Agile to make it easier for  Leaders to see how they can apply this in their daily work to enable the values of Modern Agile. We call it the Modern Agile Flower. It aims to show the big picture from a leadership perspective.

**What the organization need to focus on to enable Modern Agile is:**

-   Leadership
-   Way of Working
-   Organization
-   Competence Development
-   Improvement of Everything

##### Choosing what type of Organization you want to have Together

About a year and half ago we had a couple of workshops together with Avanza where we supported them in creating an understanding about the different type of organizations you can have, how they work and how the different ways to organize would affect their own deliveries. We had about 35-40 people signing up and joining in doing experienced based learnings and theory to enable them to make the decision together. They visualized their customer journey and all their products together as a basis for shared knowledge. One of the things we also did was to facilitate a session where they came up with 7 guiding principles on how they wanted their perfect organization to work. The day after we used these guiding principles to evaluate how well their current organization would perform in delivering 3 different type of common deliveries. The different type of organizations evaluated was value stream based, customer journey based and component team based organization -- as well as their current silos based. All work was done in small cross functional groups: We could see that all groups thought that their current organization performed really bad on all principles as well on all deliveries, and that customer journey based organization with Lean Teams would be the best 🙂 Here you can rad about the  [specific workshop where they compared the different organizations](https://dandypeople.com/blog/transforming-to-a-people-and-innovation-friendly-organisation-using-agile/)

##### Avanza Leads the way with Lean Teams and Customer Journey Organization

Now we have also seen the results at one of our lovely and brave clients, Avanza (FinTech product company), who has managed to do this.  They have reached their vision with the change, that the team feels like they are a startup! Avanza recently shared their story on how they managed to do the transformation at a meet-up in their office here in Stockholm. They have also shared the video from the presentation which you can  watch here too (thank you every one at Avanza, we love you!). They have gone from having a normal organization with Marketing, IT, Product, Operations in separate silos giving them too long lead times and inability to deliver value as they wanted, having and average of 5.8 teams involved in a normal release -- to now after the transformation only 1.2 teams! This is truly amazing since it means these teams can truly deliver customer value end to end without dependencies. The organization now has Lean Teams that are truly cross-functional, that work with Lean UX having as short feedback loops as possible and the mandate to deliver what they find valuable to the customer based on the teams mission. Employee happiness index too has gone up and people feel much more engaged.

##### Presentation on the Customer Journey Product Organization

The presentation that I have had around this topic "Customer focus with an Agile mindset" is describing why old organizations with silos cant deliver value any more, why that is, and what you can do about it.  I talk about how to go from being a snail to becoming a shark. The seminar has been very popular with fully booked monthly breakfast seminars at our HQ in Stockholm for over a year as well as talks at conferences such
as Agile Days Istanbul, Agila Örebro, Sundsvall 42 and Agile Islands. I´ve also been invited to speak internally at organizations across Sweden to inspire and give new perspectives of what Agility means for the entire organization, on a organizational as well as strategic level, and what leadership is needed to support this. This is clear signals on how important this is for many organizations right now.

Seated for Agile
----------------

### Activity Based Seating vs Flexible Seating 

#### Activity Based Seating 

-   Flow optimized, aligned with Lean & Agile thinking.
-   If there are Agile Teams, one activity the office is optimized for is Agile Teamwork.
-   <kbd>![Activity Based Seating vs Flexible Seating](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/06/abs-vs-fs2.png) More desks than people to optimize for flow.
-   Can be re-arranged quickly for new team members or team collaboration.
-   The goal is high performance teams.

#### Flexible Seating 

-   Resource optimization, against Lean & Agile thinking.
-   No personal desks, fewer seats than employees, clean desk & wall policy.
-   Optimized for individual work, not team work.
-   Many organizations say they do ABS, but it is in fact FS.
-   The organization is "blind" and teamwork is banned.
-   The goal is to save space, and money, but deliveries from teams will fail and stress will increase.

#### The Optimal Seating for an Agile Team

[<kbd>![the Team Home Zone](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/06/team-home-zone.png)](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/06/team-home-zone.png)

#### Shared Learnings 

<kbd>![](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/06/always-improve.png)

-   Have more seats than team members to enable collaboration with people outside of the team.
-   Get teams their own Home Zones for min. 6 months.
-   Let the teams decide how they want their Home Zone.
-   Have few rules, and don't punish everyone if someone can't follow them.
-   If teams can move around, it makes it easy to get team seated next to each other if close collaboration is needed -- and they can easily self organize.
-   The problems you think you will get, are not what will trouble you in the end, so think of it as a starting point, not the end solution, a lways improve.
-   Make sure to optimize for the type of activity the organization will have, team zones, quiet rooms, conference call rooms, workshop areas etc.
-   It's important that people feel they can influence their situation or they will get demotivated & stressed.
-   Invest in really good digital tools for visualization and collaboration if you want the teams to be able to move around.
-   Get both monitors and white boards on wheels if you want the teams to be able to move around as a team.
-   Show this to your Manager or the HR department, and ask them to involve people with Agile Mindset in the process to ensure securing  delivery.

#### The truth -- numbers from the survey -- 1 Positive and 9 Negative 

#### [<kbd>![](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/06/result-1-pos-vs-9-neg.png)](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/06/result-1-pos-vs-9-neg.png) 

What we learned about how Flexible Seating affect our ability to do a good job

#### Is it a Success or Failure? 

Saved \$ on space shows instantly, but decreasing deliveries and quality as well as stressed employees takes about 6-9 months.

#### The True Purpose is Important

The positive examples of ABS we've see has been made from other reasons then savings. If you are doing Flexible Seating to save money, be open and clear about that. Don't make excuses to try to convince people otherwise.

Leadership
----------

### To Lead in Complexity 

The basis for Agile leadership is that we need to have a leadership that works in complexity -- that support flexibility, transparency, collaboration and authonomy to enable the "workers" to make smart tactical and operative decisions to reach well defined impact goals. There are several common leadership concepts that support this kind of leadership;

-   Catalyst Leadership
-   Management 3.0
-   Systems Thinking
-   Servant Leadership

### Three leadership Styles 

In the poster there are three leadership styles visualized;

-   Catalyst Leadership (Best for Agile)
-   Achiever
-   Expert

The infographic contains numerous of illustrations to visualize some of the behaviours of each leadership style. I believe (without perhaps any support from research) that you can change leadership style to become a Catalyst Leader if  you make this decision, practice and work on it. I also believe that the environment we live and act in shapes how we behave and what we might see as good leadership.

### Agile Mindset and what it might mean in Reality

When you understand that Agile actually is a way of thinking, a mindset, and not a process ot tools, it usually unlocks the "next level" in your game. But many leaders might find it quite difficult to put the Agile mindset to practice in reality. What does it really mean for governance? How do we build organizations, create good salary models, plan our projects, grow our staffs knowledge, build teams...? I have covered just a tiny part of that in this poster, the list could go on forever I know.

### Need Coaching and Training for Agile Leadership? 

<kbd>![Coaching Agile Leadership](https://media.dandypeople.com/2018/01/coaching-agile-leadership.jpg)

If you need help to reshape the leadership in your organization to support your Agile journey, let us know and we'll happily join forces with you to coach and train your managers and every one else who can become leaders.

User Experience
---------------

### What does UX mean? 

UX stands for ***User Experience***. Basically, the expected and needed user experience of the service or digital product to meet user and business goals. To connect user needs and business goals is basic when working with user experience, it is basic to meet users and understand who they are -- and involve and understand stakeholders. Any team can work with UX as long as they get to do this, and have the methods and processes to do it in a structured and effective way.

#### What does Agile UX mean? 

***Agile UX***  is about the collaboration between humans to find usable and feasible solutions. The collaboration in Agile teams is key to find good solutions. the more diverge the team is doing ideating, the better the solutions will be.

### What does Lean UX mean? 

***Lean UX*** is about getting quick feedback, work hypothesis driven, do user centric experiments, work data driven and deliver in really small batches and often. It works very well wth Agile, and the Agile cadence in Scrum, and brings a lot of intelligence to the team to make smart decisions. It often means that a Scrum teams needs to change they idea of the solution more often than an "old school Scrum team". That's why I call it a "Agile Lean Team" instead of a "Scrum Team" or an "Agile Team".

To be able to work with Lean UX and be data driven, an organization needs to be mature in the sense it has to set clear measurable goals, be transparent and give mandate and support to teams to meet the goals -- an Agile Lean team working with Lean UX knows the solution will change quickly, but the goal and the problem will not, and it´s up to the teams to solve the puzzle.

### Do you do "UX" and then development? 

Many Agile teams also struggle with how to combine the discovery work (user research, finding solutions and testing) with delivery (building, coding, and designing solutions) when working in Scrum, and because this is often difficult to integrate without friction,  many designers and design teams find them selves cut of from the agile process, leaving them to work in their own silo with their own process -- just as the development team find them self cut of from ideating and becoming more or less development robots. This is usually never a good situation for anyone -- and especially not for the user who usually experience bad user experience when there is hand offs in the process.

When design teams are places in silos they usually deliver design, strategy and prototypes that are well thought through in usability and look and feel -- but it might not be feasible, which makes it bad user experience in the end anyway. This also makes it difficult to do incremental and iterative delivery -- and usually very little collaboration between competences and learning what solution solves user
problems or not.

### Is UX a Role? 

***UX, or User Experience*** is not a role, it´s a competence, and a responsibility for the full Agile Lean Team. It´s the teams responsible to meet users to understand needs and behaviors and to find and build usable, feasible, and sellable solutions. Though there are as we know many product designers calling them selves UXers, and these people usually have a wide spread of competences from strategy, user research, information architecture, interaction design, graphic design, art direction, A/B testing, and front end development. But to have a user perspective you also need to meet the user, have empathy for users or have some way to understand the user. Designers have a basic need to understand needs to design solutions, and this process needs to be combined with Agile to become collaborative and effectively generate feedback to the team.

Product Ownership
-----------------

As Agile practices proves to work better than other practices and spreads, it starts to involve the organization outside of IT or the development department. When companies start moving towards a more Agile organization across the silos, they might realize they are missing actual product owners and a product owner organization with representation from the business, and they bring in people from the business side to the PO role. What might strike many new product owners is how different the Agile way of working is (usually they love it), and how different the PO role is from their earlier experiences, maybe as a mid level manager. The product ownership is about NOT managing the details, NOR the people. It´s NOT EVEN about knowing what the solution should be. It might off course seem a bit frightening and confusing to some people, depending of the company culture off course, to focus on vision and learning along the way what is the right thing to do.

The Agile Product Ownership (not role) is about trusting in the capabilities of the team, and the process of learning as a team, prototyping and testing to find what is valuable and deliver piece by piece. The every day of Agile business and working as a Product Owner is about delivering value. And it is so rewarding when you know that you can do that, even though you in the early stages had no idea what the solution would feel like or look like, and that was probably the only thing you could agree about 🙂 Being able to trust that process and using proper methods to learn and deliver valuable solutions piece by piece, and doing it over and over again. That is what good product ownership is about -- and it´s teamwork, not a one mans job.

As you already understand I don´t see the product ownership as A role, I see it as a process. I know a share that with my colleague Tomer Shalit (maybe you as well), who co created this poster with me as a result of many discussions, trainings and workshops.

The product ownership process goes all the way from being a Agile leader with a catalyst leadership, creating a vision, clear and measurable goals, to learning what problems needed to be solved to reach the goals, for who and in what context. To planning and breaking it down to smaller releases that can be supported by the technical infrastructure and then following up if you reached the goals or not. In contrary from what many might say, I don´t think the the Product Owner has nothing to do with the actual solution. The solution is up to the team to create. To manage this, obviously, the team need have a clear picture of what problem they are solving, and for who... otherwise the team can´t learn what is a good solution or not, or even what´s a good enough solution, and they definitely can´t innovate. If this works, the PO and the team can manage
in uncertainty and deliver early business value and do continuous discovery and delivery. Giving them the super powers to always being able to deliver on time and creating valuable solutions that over time that can be scaled and cater for all type of business and user needs. As I see it, this is the ultimate goal for Agile teams, and the Product Owner is the enabler for that.

Change Management
-----------------

While many change management methodologies contain proven methods based on substantial experience and research, not enough is done to cater for the highly complex nature of change where you can't simply "plan-and-execute" and get it right the first time. An iterative approach with rapid feedback and gradual learning is therefore suggested here.

Similarly, lean or agile methods risk being not deep enough if only focusing on basic PDCA. We want to include best practice in defining the problem to be solved together with assessment of the change capability of the people and organization going through the change. To assert that improvement has happened beyond a shadow of a doubt in a high-variation environments, statistical significance between baseline and new performance data should be established.

At Dandy People we have therefore combined the best parts of both approaches into what we label Agile Change Management and condensed it into one poster. At the center is the Agile Change Process which is made up of an outer circle representing a change that is needed. It contains both a  **people track** and a  **system** **track** as both dimensions are needed for change to happen quickly and ensure return on investment. The inner circle is the iterative discovery of what  **actually **works in terms of bringing people and system to work in a new and improved way. The poster is based on concepts from Lean, Agile, DMAIC and the
Standard by ACMP.
