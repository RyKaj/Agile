Agile : SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) 
=====================================


![](attachments/451819560/463513857.png)


What is a Scaled Agile Framework?
=================================

SAFe
----

The Scaled Agile Framework is a framework that provides four different
layers of agile-lean adoptions.

Scaled agile framework abbreviated as SAFe is a framework of proven,
integrated principles, practices and competencies for Lean, Agile, and
DevOps.  SAFe is a scalable and configurable framework that helps
organizations in  [scaling
agile](https://reqtest.com/agile-blog/scaling-agile-reqtest/) and
lean.

![SAFe](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/SAFe.png)
![](attachments/463506521/471992239.png)

Scaled Agile Framework addresses the problems encountered when scaling
agile beyond a single team.  SAFe promotes collaboration, coordination,
and delivery across a large number of agile teams. This framework
leverages three primary bodies of knowledge:

-   Agile software development
-   Lean product development
-   System thinking

Scaled Agile Framework SAFe, is a freely available online knowledge base
that allows you to apply lean-agile practices at the enterprise level.
It provides a simple, lightweight experience for the software
development team. The whole framework is divided into three segments 
**Team, Program and Portfolio**. We will see this in detail later on

-   Implementing Lean-Agile software and systems in enterprise level
-   It\'s based on Lean and Agile principles.
-   It gives detailed guidance for work at the enterprise Portfolio,
    Value Stream, Program, and Team.
-   It\'s designed to meet the needs of all stakeholders within an
    organization.

SAFe was first developed in the field and was elaborated in  **Dean
Leffingwell\'**s books and blog. Version 1.0 is the first official
release in 2011. The latest version is 4.6, was released in October
2018. It provides guidance to work at enterprise Portfolio, Value
Stream, Program, and Team levels.

These five competencies are:

1.  **Lean agile leadership:** Leaders should drive and support
    organizational change and operational effectiveness. Ultimately, it
    is the leadership team that has the authority to influence
    individuals and teams to achieve their potential.
2.  **Team and technical agility:** Teams must possess certain vital
    skills and adhere to Lean agile practices to create well-designed
    solutions quickly. Ensuring the technical agility of teams is
    especially important as they are the ones who ultimately perform the
    actual work that will be delivered to your customers.
3.  **DevOps and release on demand:** The establishment of a continual,
    ongoing pipeline for deliverables is vital for creating value to
    meet your customers' needs.
4.  **Business solutions and Lean systems engineering:** The more
    organizations facilitate Lean agile practices to drive blueprints,
    development and deployment, the more innovative they can be.
5.  **Lean portfolio management:** A sound organizational strategy that
    includes financial considerations, portfolio management and
    compliance-related aspects is essential to SAFe success.

### When to Use Scaled Agile Framework 

-   When a team is interested to implement an agile approach
    consistently across larger, multi-team programs and portfolios.
-   When multiple teams are running their own way of Agile
    implementation but regularly facing obstacles, delays, and failures.
-   When teams want to work independently.
-   When you want to scale Agile across the organization but not sure
    what new roles may be needed or what existing roles (i.e.,
    management) need to change and how.
-   When you have attempted to scale the Agile across your organization
    but struggling in alignment to achieve uniform or consistent
    strategy across business departments from portfolio to program and
    team levels.
-   When an organization needs to improve its product development lead
    time and want to know how other companies have succeeded in scaling
    Agile with SAFe.

### How different than other Agile practices 

-   It\'s publicly available and free to use.
-   Available in a highly approachable and usable form.
-   It\'s lightweight, practically proven results and specific to level.
-   It constantly/regularly modifies/maintains most commonly used agile
    practices.
-   Offers useful extensions to common agile practices.
-   Grounds agile practices to an enterprise context.
-   Offers complete picture of software development.
-   Visibility or transparency is more on all the levels.
-   Continues or regular feedback on quality and improvement.

SAFe Formation
--------------

Let\'s start our discussion on Scaled Agile Framework and its formation.
By now, we have clearly articulated and understood the need to have a
Scaled Agile Framework in an organization.

Now, conceptualize an environment where we have multiple teams working
under similar conditions to achieve the same objective. It is time for
us to move ahead and see how Agile Scaled Framework such as Scaled Scrum
works in this space.

-   All the stakeholders (Internal or External) and management come
    along together to create a very high-level Portfolio Vision Document
    which is also called as Portfolio Backlog. Portfolio Backlog is
    essentially consisting of multiple Business and architectural
    requirements which is also known as Epics. These business and
    architectural epics are aligned with priorities.

![Epic](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/Epic.png)

-   Based on the priorities, these epics are picked up by the Product
    Managers/Delivery Managers. They create a well-defined Roadmap and a
    Vision Document. They do this activity by discussing the release
    plan with the Release Management Team to align the roadmap with the
    production releases.
-   Once the Roadmap and Vision Document is created, the Product
    Manager's next step is to create a backlog of Program Backlog. A
    Program Backlog consists of Release Items, Functional bits and a
    pool of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs).
-   The Release Management Team prepares a release plan to fit in the
    features in the release cycles.
-   The Release Management Team now works on the feature bits to fulfill
    the Release Plan and objectives. They also work on preparing the
    architecture and infrastructure to enable smooth releases.
-   From the Program Backlog, we move towards an individual Product
    Backlog which is also known as Team Backlog. Release/System Team
    have their own Product Backlog, similarly, all the Scrum Team
    working on the project will have their individual Product Backlog.
-   Product Backlog consists of both functional and non-functional
    stories. These stories are prioritized by the Product Owner who is
    working on that Scrum Team.
-   Typically there are 5-10 Scrum Teams that are working in a Scaled
    Agile Environment. Each of the Scrum Team has a Product Owner, Scrum
    Master, and a Development Team. The roles and responsibilities of
    each of the Scrum Team Member in Scaled Scrum are the same as that
    in the normal Scrum Environment.
-   The Scrum Team performs all the Scrum Ceremonies and works on
    developing the Increment to be delivered at the end of each sprint.

### Core Values 

Alignment, Built-in Quality, Alignment and Transparency

-   Communication and Collaboration between the Scrum Teams is the key
    to a successful Scaled Scrum in terms of productivity, quality and
    time to market.

A few tweaks here and there in a Scrum Framework can lead to incredible
results in the form of Scaled Scrum.

![Core Value](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/Core-Value.png)

SAFe Configuration
------------------

The below image explains how agile process works. Epics are a large body
of work, which is further broken down into a number of smaller stories
or sub-epics. These sub-epics are allocated to the team as a story. Each
team then work on these stories or software features accordingly. SAFe
supports the full range of development environments with four
configurations,

![SAFe Configuration](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/SAFe-Configuration.png)
![](attachments/463506521/471992241.png)

### 1. Essential SAFe

-   The Essential SAFe configuration is the heart of the Framework and
    is the simplest starting point for implementation.
-   It's the basic building block for all other SAFe configurations and
    describes the most critical elements that are required to realize
    the majority of the Framework's benefits.
-   The Team and Program Levels form an organizational structure called
    the Agile Release Train (ART), where Agile teams, key stakeholders,
    and other resources are dedicated to an important, ongoing solution
    mission.

### 2. Portfolio SAFe

-   The Portfolio SAFe configuration helps to align portfolio execution
    to the enterprise strategy.
-   Organized around the flow of value.
-   Lean-Agile budgeting empowers decision makers.
-   Kanban system provides portfolio visibility and WIP limits.
-   Enterprise architecture guides larger technology decisions.
-   Objective metrics support governance and improvement.
-   Value delivery via Epics.

### 3. Large Solution SAFe

-   Large Solution SAFe configuration is for developing the largest and
    most complex solutions that typically require multiple Agile release
    trains and Suppliers, but do not require portfolio-level
    considerations.
-   This is common for industries like aerospace, defense, automotive
    etc.
-   The Solution Train organizational construct of the Large Solution
    Level helps enterprises that face the biggest challenges---building
    large-scale, multidisciplinary software, hardware, and complex IT
    systems.
-   Building these solutions requires additional roles, artifacts,
    events, and coordination.

### 4. Full SAFe 

-   The Full SAFe configuration is the most comprehensive version of the
    Framework.
-   It supports enterprises that build and maintain large integrated
    solutions, that require hundreds of people or more, and includes all
    levels of SAFe: team, program, large solution, and portfolio.
-   In largest enterprises, multiple instances of various SAFe
    configurations may be required.

Foundation
----------

The Foundation contains the supporting principles, values, mindset,
implementation guidance, and leadership roles that are required to
deliver the value successfully at scale.

![](attachments/463506521/471992242.png) 

Lean-Agile Leaders ------------------

Management has the ultimate responsibility for business outcomes.
Leaders must be trained, and then become trainers of, these leaner ways
of thinking and operating. To this end, SAFe describes a new style of
leadership that is exhibited by the enterprise's leaders.

Lean-Agile leaders lead his\\her Organization in building better systems
through iterative and incremental ways of learning, coaching, developing
people and processes.

![SAFe Lean-Agile
Leaders](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/SAFe-Lean-Agile-Leaders.png) 

SAFe Lean-Agile Leaders are lifelong learners and teachers who help the
teams to build better systems through understanding and exhibiting the
Lean-Agile Mindset and SAFe Principles

Core Values  
-----------

Four core values define the belief system for SAFe:

### Program Execution 

-   Program execution is the most important core values as it compares
    to other values without which the execution team cannot deliver any
    value to the customer.
-   Mainly it focuses on working software and great customer experience.
-   Complex software development is accomplished with the help of
    inspecting and adept at the end and performs better in every PI.
-   Not only the teams but with the help of Agile leaders, the
    leadership team can also perform customer satisfaction

### Transparency

-   At every level i.e. team, program, value stream, and portfolio level
    we have a whiteboard which displays information about project
    progress at any point of time.
-   The team follows agile scrum, hence all the team members trust each
    other and are free to take decisions which foster innovations.
-   Encourages open and honest communication with all stakeholders.
-   Value productivity, quality, transparency, and openness over
    internal politics.

### Built-in Quality  

-   Incrementally adopt the Built-in Quality practices for software,
    hardware, and firmware. Understand, teach, or sponsor technical
    skills development in support of high-quality code, components,
    systems, and solutions.
-   Foster Communities of Practice.
-   Understand, support, and apply Agile Architecture and Lean User
    Experience (UX)

Lean-Agile Mindset 
------------------

### SAFe Manifesto

These basic principles and values for SAFe must be understood, exhibited
and continued in order to get the desired results.

-   Take an economic view
-   Apply systems thinking
-   Assume variability; preserve options
-   Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles
-   Base milestones on an objective evaluation of working systems
-   Visualize and limit WIP, reduce batch sizes and manage queue lengths
-   Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
-   Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
-   Decentralize decision-making

Lean-Agile Leaders are lifelong learners and teachers. They understand
and embrace Lean and Agile principles & practices.

![Lean-Agile mindset](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/Lean-Agile-mindset.png)

**Our Lean-Agile mindset is represented in two things:**

**(i) The House of Lean:**

The House of Lean is the one which you see here.

**It has a number of elements:**

**Value,** as the goal of Lean is very simple, it has the shortest
sustainable lead time. That\'s accomplished by the pillars of  **respect
for people and culture**, product development flow,
innovation---critical to long-term sustainability---and relentless
improvement. And it\'s supported by  **leadership**.

That\'s the structure in which we tend to think about the Lean paradigm.

Everything else is the same as Agile Manifesto

### Agile Manifesto

>     “agile” is a state of being, not a process. It is a feeling that drives development and delivery. In teams I would consider agile, none of them operated exactly like the others; and some actions that would improve agility in one team would harm it in another. Some companies are able to mimic that feeling by embracing agile principles, and others aren’t. The important part isn’t the specific methodology that others say will help you achieve max productivity for your team, it’s the process that aligns with your culture and your software and your customer.

#### Agile 

Agile is an umbrella term used to describe a project management
methodology which breaks down large complex projects into smaller
manageable chunks. Agile project management has been used in software
development to speed up the completion of projects, but now, we see
these practices being applied in a multitude of industries. \" [Agile is
a set of guiding principles developed in 2001 published as
the ] [[Agile
Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)] [.
Scrum and Kanban, on the other hand, are two methodologies which are
considered to be Agile. Or to put it another way, if you want to work in
an agile fashion, Scrum and Kanban are two ways to do it.]"
said Nicholas Carrier, Associate Partner at London-based 
[Prophet](https://www.prophet.com/) .

A structured and iterative approach to project management and product
development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and
provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change
without going off the rails. Today, agile is hardly a competitive
advantage. No one has the luxury to develop a product for years or even
months in a black box. This means it's more important than ever to get
it right.

Agile software development is based on an incremental, iterative
approach. Instead of in-depth planning at the beginning of the project,
Agile methodologies are open to changing requirements over time and
encourages constant feedback from the end users. Cross-functional teams
work on iterations of a product over a period of time, and this work is
organized into a backlog that is prioritized based on business or
customer value. The goal of each iteration is to produce a working
product.

In Agile methodologies, leadership encourages teamwork, accountability,
and face-to-face communication. Business stakeholders and developers
must work together to align the product with customer needs and company
goals.

\

#### Agile Manifesto

*We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and
helping others do it.*

*Through this work we have come to value:*

***Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools*

***Working software** over comprehensive documentation*

***Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation*

***Responding to change** over following a plan*

*That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the
items on the left more.*

*![The Agile mindset](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fstevedenning%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F06%2FWhat-is-Ageil-by-Ahmed-Sidky-r1-e1525717850723.jpg)
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/762/0*9Y9PqVi1GXK7uICp)

#### Human Resource Manifesto

We follow these principles:

Support people to engage, grow,

and be happy in their workplace.

Encourage people to welcome change

and adapt when needed.

Help to build and support networks of empowered,

self-organising and collaborative teams.

Nourish and support the people's and team's motivation

and capabilities, help them build the environment they need,

and trust them to get the job done.

Facilitate and nurture personal growth,

to harness employee's different strengths and talents.

12 Principles
-------------

1.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
    continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile
    processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3.  Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a
    couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4.  Business people and developers must work together daily throughout
    the project.
5.  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the
    environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job
    done.
6.  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to
    and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors,
    developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace
    indefinitely.
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
    enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is
    essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
    self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
    effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Agile Leadership
----------------

1.  When there are leadership and guidance, not command & control.
2.  When there is alignment across the organization instead of the
    pursuit of local optimization efforts or personal agendas.
3.  When the collaboration of all participants beyond hierarchies is the
    norm, not an exception.
4.  When we acknowledge that management principles of the 19th century
    are unsuited to solve complex problems of the 21st century.
5.  When managers become servant leaders.

The following paragraphs focus on the main concepts related to agile
leadership: from servant leadership to the agile mindset to creating a
learning organization. The lists are not supposed to be comprehensive
but provide the interested reader with a starting point for further
research.

### Servant Leadership

"A Servant Leader shares power puts the needs of the employees first and
helps people develop and perform as highly as possible. Instead of the
people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the
people."

Source:  [Wikipedia on Servant Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership "Wikipedia on Servant Leadership").

Servant leadership is a suitable approach to dealing with complexity.
Complexity --- the unknown unknowns --- determines decision-making
processes and is characterized by:

-   More unpredictability than predictability.
-   Emergent answers.
-   Many competing ideas.
-   Cause and effect can only be determined in retrospect.

For a much more elaborate approach to complexity, see the  [Cynefin framework by Dave Snowden](https://cognitive-edge.com/ "Agile Leadership: Cynefin framework").

Servant leadership is not a new concept:

"A leader is best when people barely know he exists when his work is
done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves." ( [Lao
Tzu, 4th century
BC.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi))

Servant leadership is characterized by:

-   Service to others.
-   Promotion of community.
-   Creation of a shared vision.
-   A holistic approach to work.
-   A shared decision-making process.

Servant leadership thus seems suited to overcome the industrial
paradigm. Source: 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership "Wikipedia on Servant Leadership").

#### Intent-based Leadership

The principles of intent-based leadership according to David Marquet are
as follows:

-   Create leaders, not followers.
-   Resist the urge to resolve the problems of your people.
-   Take deliberate action.
-   Learn everywhere at any time.
-   Specify goals, not methods.
-   Don't empower, emancipate.

Agile Mindset
-------------

As to what "having an Agile mindset" means, things were initially
unclear. Some resorted to the Supreme Court's approach to defining
pornography: "You know it when you see it." Yet over time, the nature
and content of the Agile mindset have clarified, particularly by way of
contrast to the  *bureaucratic mindset* that is still prevalent in many
large organizations.

Practitioners are thus said to have  *an Agile mindset* when they are
preoccupied---and sometimes obsessed---with innovating and delivering
steadily more  *customer* value, with getting work done in small
self-organizing  *teams*, and with collaborating together in an
interactive  *network*. Such organizations have been shown to have the
capacity to adapt rapidly to a quickly shifting marketplace.

The bureaucracy that ensues from such a mindset often finds it hard to
adapt to a world in massive rapid change.

The two different kinds of mindsets exert a powerful influence on the
behavior of their respective organizations and can be seen as having
the  *de facto* force of organizational laws, as shown here.

![The Agile mindset vs the bureaucratic mindset](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fstevedenning%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F08%2Fmindset-table.jpg)

It's not that those with a  *bureaucratic mindset* don't care about the
customer: it's just that they generally focus more on making money for
the company and its shareholders. Nor do they never use teams; it's that
in a bureaucracy, self-organizing teams are the exception, not the rule.
Nor is operating as a network unknown in a bureaucracy: it's just that
maintaining the pyramid of layers and divisions is seen as more
important.

A bureaucratic mindset, when shared by tens of thousands of staff, tends
to create a radically different---and less adaptable---kind of
organization than one peopled by those with an Agile mindset.

### Agile As A Professional Mindset 
It may be better to think of the Agile mindset as something akin to the
mindset of a profession, such as that of a lawyer, a doctor or an
economist. Thus, lawyers, doctors, and economists think about certain
problems in characteristic ways. They notice certain kinds of
information, data, and concerns in their respective subjects. They
analyze the issues in their respective ways. They pursue their
respective kinds of solutions. These different ways of thinking,
perceiving and acting as lawyers, doctors, and economists, are acquired
over years of training and practice, which in turn generate
characteristic attitudes, values, modes of thought and approaches to
problems. Professional mindsets are not things that can be acquired
overnight or a two-day training course.

Similarly, those managers with an Agile mindset also pay attention to
certain kinds of information, data, and concerns. They analyze problems
in particular ways. They tend to pursue certain kinds of
solutions---focusing on value for customers, working in small teams and
operating as a network. Their ways of thinking, perceiving and acting
are often acquired over a period of years of practice. We should not be
surprised that the Agile mindset too isn't something that can be
acquired overnight or a two-day training course.

What we are talking about with the Agile mindset is the emergence of
management itself---finally---becoming a real profession.

### The Nature Of The Agile Mindset 

The Agile mindset is an attribute of practitioners more than theorists.
It is pragmatic and action-oriented more than a theoretical philosophy.
It goes beyond a set of beliefs and becomes a tool for diagnosis and the
basis for action. It tends to be built on the hard-won knowledge of
experience and crafted from the lessons of trying to cope with massive
change in the face of incomprehensible complexity.

The Agile mindset might also be called a framework, a paradigm, or a
common model. Yet "mindset" seems a better choice of word, reflecting a
coherent tradition of exploration, paths of analysis and patterns of
reasoning.

The Agile mindset reflects ways of thinking that have developed over
time. It is a certain cast of mind that emphasizes some things over
others. It should continue to grow and evolve. It reflects attitudes and
viewpoints that tend to endure. Over time, it leads to people being seen
as having a certain makeup or character. Once we have understood the
Agile mindset, we can anticipate types of behavior that should occur.

The 'agile mindset' discussion seems to be centered around five areas:
complexity and planning, delivering value, self-organization, fostering
collaboration, and cross-functionality of teams:

### Mindset, Complexity, and Planning

-   The definition of mindset: " [The established set of attitudes held by someone](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mindset "The Oxford Disctionaries on Mindset")."
-   The complexity challenge:
    -   The  [scientific management methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management "Wikipedia on Scientific Management") of Frederick Taylor does not apply to "creative work." -   Problem-solving in a complex environment cannot be achieved with "more" planning.
    -   The future in the complex or chaotic domain cannot be predicted.
    -   Hence different approaches need to be employed when dealing with creative solutions in unchartered territory, for example,  [Empiricism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/empiricism "The Encyclopedia Britannica on Empiricism") or  [Lean](https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/).

### Focus on Delivering Value

-   Continuous value delivery to customers; outcome over output.
    (Manifesto of Agile Software Development: " [Working software is the
    primary measure of
    progress](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html "Principles behind the Agile Manifesto").")
-   Continuous learning & applying empiricism:
    -   Deming:  [PDCA
        cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA).
    -   Empiricism: Transparency, inspection, adaptation.
    -   Iterative, incremental.
    -   Accepting that failure is more than an option but inevitable.
    -   Willingness to adapt to change.

### Self-Organization

-   Teams can best decide how to accomplish work and achieve the goal.
-   Teams outperform individuals.
-   Team building is a crucial success factor: The team wins, the team
    fails.
-   [Optimize for flow not
    utilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CostXs2p6r0),
    and move from push to flow.
-   The importance of values:  [courage, commitment, focus, openness,
    respect](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#values "The Scrum Guide on Scrum Values").

### Fostering collaboration

-   Creating psychological safety and equal speaking opportunity.
-   Respect for individuals.
-   Inclusion and diversity.
-   [Core
    Protocols](https://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/ "Jim and Michele McCarthy: The Core Protocols"):
    Opt-in, opt-out, law of 2 feet --- creative work requires voluntary
    participation.
-   Prime directive: stop protecting the organization by assuming people
    come to the office to "rip you off."
-   [Give people a voice, provide an opportunity to be
    heard](https://management30.com/podcast/the-secret-to-creating-high-performing-teams/).

\[NYTimes.\]

### Cross-functional Teams

-   End-to-end (value) delivery capability of teams.
-   The autonomous pursuit of customer value balanced with
    accountability.
-   Abandoning functional silos in favor of focusing on delivering
    value.
-   Avoidance of local optimization.
-   A cornerstone on the path to achieving business agility.

Creating a Learning Organization
--------------------------------

Peter Senge is a Senior Lecturer in Leadership and Sustainability at the
MIT Sloan School of Management and coined the term 'learning
organization' in his book ' [The Fifth
Discipline](https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Learning-Organization/dp/0385517254/ref=sr_1_fkmr2_1 "Peter Senge: The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization"):'

-   "[The only sustainable competitive advantage is an organization\'s
    ability to learn faster than the
    competition](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/21072.Peter_M_Senge "Peter Senge on the Learning Organization")."
-   "People working together at their best. It's a continuous,
    relentless process."
-   There are two mindsets that can infiltrate an organization: control
    and learning.

These are the characteristics of a learning organization according to
Peter Senge:

-   System thinking: assessing businesses as a system of bounded
    objects.
-   Personal mastery: the commitment of an individual to the process of
    learning.
-   Mental models: assumptions and generalizations held by individuals
    and organizations.
-   Shared vision: Creating a collective identity to provide focus and
    energy for learning.
-   Team learning: The accumulation of individual learning.

Harvard Business School professor David A. Garvin defines a learning
organization as follows:

-   "A learning organization is an organization skilled at creating,
    acquiring, and transferring knowledge, and at modifying its behavior
    to reflect new knowledge and insights."
-   New ideas, insights or moments of creativity are necessary to
    trigger organizational change. They are not sufficient, though to
    create a learning organization. The changes to the way work are
    accomplished need to follow suit.

Traditional vs. Agile Leadership Behaviour - A Cheat Sheet
----------------------------------------------------------

We can aggregate and condense the before mentioned concepts and
principles into a comparison of the traditional management style and
agile leadership:

### Traditional Management \<=\> Agile Leadership

1.  Predictive, long-term planning \<=\> Provision of vision, strategy,
    and direction
2.  Control of work, task assignment \<=\> Fostering self-organization
3.  Maximize utilization and capacity \<=\> Supporting teams by removing
    what is impeding them
4.  The go-to problem fixer for subordinates \<=\> Let those closest to
    the problem figure out a solution
5.  Motivating others by extrinsic incentives (bonuses, titles, etc.)
    \<=\> Motivating others by enabling autonomy, mastery, and purpose
6.  Information flows up the hierarchy (reports, meetings) \<=\>
    Management moves to where the information is, for example, by
    participation in Sprint Reviews.

### Subway Map to Agile Practices

![](attachments/451817509/451817512.jpg)

4. SAFe Principles 
------------------

SAFe practices are grounded in nine principles that synthesize Agile
methods, Lean product development, systems thinking, and decades of
field experience.

1.  Take an economic view
2.  Apply systems thinking
3.  Assume variability, preserve options
4.  Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles.
5.  Base milestones on an objective evaluation of working systems
6.  Visualize and limit WIP, reduce batch sizes, and manage queue
    lengths
7.  Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
8.  Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
9.  Decentralize decision-making

5. Implementation Roadmap 
-------------------------

Implementing the changes that are necessary to become a Lean-Agile
technology enterprise is a substantial change for most companies. SAFe
provides an implementation roadmap to help or guide organizations on
this journey.

Finally, let\'s discuss implementation. We\'ll describe that using our
Implementing SAFe 1-2-3 model.

Number 1 is to train the Lean-Agile change agents. We call those SAFe
Program Consultants. With a sufficient staff of Lean-Agile change agents
onsite, and working with your partners, you\'ll have the ability to
train the executives and leaders and managers who are the people
responsible for managing the people who deliver value.

They\'ll then be in a position to support the launch of the Agile
Release Trains. And with one train at a time, you\'ll build that Agile
portfolio.





Lean Portfolio Management
=========================

![](https://lm2jj13uhv2157rey3v60xm8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Keystone-LPM-WEB-1.png)

The Lean Portfolio Management (LPM) competency aligns strategy and
execution by applying Lean and systems thinking approaches to strategy
and investment funding, Agile portfolio operations, and governance.
These collaborations give the enterprise the ability to execute existing
commitments reliably and better enable innovation by building on the
foundation of the four other core competencies.\
\
The reason for Lean Portfolio Management is straightforward: traditional
approaches to portfolio management inhibit the flow of value and
innovation in the enterprise. They were not designed for a global
economy and the impact of digital disruption. This new reality puts
pressure on enterprises to work with a higher degree of uncertainty yet
deliver innovative solutions much faster. Despite this new reality, many
legacy portfolio practices remain. Typically, these include: Annual
planning and rigid budgeting cycles Measures of progress that focus on
document-driven deliverables and task completion, versus objective
measures of value Perpetual overload of demand versus capacity, which
decreases throughput and belies effective strategy Phase-gate approval
processes that don't mitigate risk and discourage incremental delivery
Project-based funding (moving people to the work) and cost accounting,
which causes friction and unnecessary overhead, finger pointing,
bureaucracy, and delays Overly detailed business cases based on highly
speculative and lagging ROI projections Centralizing and developing
requirements with people who will not be doing the actual implementation
Iron-triangle strangulation (fixed scope, cost, and date projects),
which limits agility and does not optimize the total economic value
Traditional Supplier management and coordination, which favors win-lose
contracts, and focuses on the lowest short-term cost, rather than the
highest lifecycle value Also, when portfolio management is unfamiliar
with software capitalization in Agile, it often impedes the
transformation to Lean-Agile approaches. Clearly, portfolio management
approaches must be modernized to support the new Lean-Agile way of
working. Fortunately, many enterprises have already gone down this path,
and the change patterns are fairly clear, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Most of these will occur naturally in a SAFe transformation, but change
is hard, indeed. Caution and awareness are warranted.

![](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Extend-the-Portfolio_F01_WP.png)

There are SAFe portfolios that manage a set of value streams for a
specific area of the business.  LPM function conducts its work with the
help of a series of three collaborations that include:

-   Strategy and investment funding
-   Agile portfolio operations
-   Lean governance

These collaborations provide the ability to execute existing commitments
reliably and enable innovation to the enterprise by building on the
foundation of four other competencies.

Scaled Agile Framework(SAFe): It stands on the foundations of its
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Lean-Agile Principles

These basic principles and values for SAFe must be understood, exhibited
and continued in order to get the desired results.

-   Take an economic view
-   Apply systems thinking
-   Assume variability; preserve options
-   Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles
-   Base milestones on an objective evaluation of working systems
-   Visualize and limit WIP, reduce batch sizes and manage queue lengths
-   Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
-   Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
-   Decentralize decision-making

### 2. Core Values

The SAFe agile is based on these four values.

#### Alignment 

-   SAFe supports alignment.
-   Alignment starts at,
    -   Strategic Themes in Portfolio Backlog and
    -   Moves down to Vision and Roadmap of Program Backlogs and then
    -   Moves to the Team Backlogs.

#### Built-in Quality

-   It ensures that every incremental delivery reflects the quality
    standards.
-   Quality is not \"added later\" is built in.
-   Built-in quality is a prerequisite of Lean and its mandatory

#### Transparency 

-   Transparency is the enabler for trust.
-   SAFe helps the enterprise to achieve transparency at all levels-
    Executives, Portfolio Managers, and other stakeholders.
-   Everyone can see into the portfolio backlog/Kanban, program
    backlogs/Kanban, and Team Backlog/Kanban.
-   Each level has a clear understanding of the PI goals.
-   Train Programs have visibility into the team\'s backlogs, as well
    other program backlogs
-   Teams and programs have visibility into business and architecture
    Epics. They can see what might be headed their way.

#### Program Execution 

-   SAFe places great focus on working systems and resultant business
    outcomes.
-   SAFe is not useful if teams can\'t execute and continuously deliver
    value.

### 3. Lean-Agile Leadership

![](https://lm2jj13uhv2157rey3v60xm8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Keystone-LAL-WEB-1.png)

The Lean-Agile Leaders are lifelong learners and teachers. It helps
teams to build better systems through understanding and exhibiting the
Lean-Agile SAFe Principles.

As an enabler for the teams, the ultimate responsibility is adoption,
success and ongoing improvement of Lean-Agile developments. For the
change and continuous improvement, leaders must be trained.

Leaders need to adopt a new style of leadership. One that truly empowers
and engages individuals and teams to reach their highest potential.

#### Principles of these Lean-Agile Leaders 

-   Lead the Change
-   Know the Way; Emphasize Lifelong Learning
-   Develop People
-   Inspire and Align with Mission; Minimize Constraints
-   Decentralize Decision-Making
-   Unlock the Intrinsic Motivation of Knowledge Workers

### 4. Lean-Agile Mind-set

Lean-Agile mindset is represented in two things:

1.  The SAFe House of Lean
2.  Agile Manifesto

#### The SAFe House of Lean 

SAFe is derived from Lean manufacturing principles and practices. Based
on these factors SAFe presents the \"SAFe House of Lean\". It is
inspired by \"house\" of lean Toyota.

The Goal of lean is unbeatable: To deliver maximum customer value in the
shortest lead time with the highest possible quality to customer

Below figure explains the Goal, Pillars, and Foundation of \"SAFe House
of Lean.\"

![](https://lm2jj13uhv2157rey3v60xm8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SAFe-House-of-Lean-changes-1.png)

#### Agile Manifesto 

Refer to [Agile Methodology & Best
Practices](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=451817499)

#### Different Levels of SAFe 

There are two different types of SAFe implementation:

1.  **SAFe 4.0 implementation**
2.  **SAFe 3.0 implementation**

[![](https://www.guru99.com/images/8-2016/090116_0956_WhatisScale8.png)](https://www.guru99.com/images/8-2016/090116_0956_WhatisScale8.png)

-   In SAFe 4.0 implementation we have 4-Levels:  **Portfolio, Value
    Stream, Program, and Team.**
-   In SAFe 3.0 implementation we have 3-Levels:  **Portfolio, Program,
    and Team**
-   3-Level SAFe is for smaller implementations with 100 or fewer
    people. Programs that do not require significant collaboration.
-   4-Level SAFe is for solutions that typically require many hundreds
    of practitioners to develop deploy and maintain software.

### Portfolio Level

The Portfolio Level contains the principles, practices, and roles needed
to initiate and govern a set of development Value Streams. This is where
strategy and investment funding are defined for value streams and their
Solutions. This level also provides Agile portfolio operations and Lean
governance for the people and resources needed to deliver solutions. The
portfolio level aligns enterprise strategy to portfolio execution by
organizing the Lean-Agile Enterprise around the flow of value through
one or more value streams. Delivering the basic budgeting and necessary
governance mechanisms, including Lean Budget Guardrails, it help assures
that the Value Streams and its trains are focused on building the right
things with the appropriate level of investments to these solutions in
order for the portfolio to meet its strategic objectives. In the
small-to-midsize enterprise, one SAFe Portfolio can typically govern the
entire technical solution set. In larger enterprises---usually those
with more than 500 to 1,000 technical practitioners---there can be
multiple SAFe portfolios, typically one for each line of business, or as
otherwise structured around the business organization and funding model.

-   Highest level of interest/ concern /involvement/ in SAFe is  **SAFe
    Portfolio**
-   The portfolio provides the basic blocks for organizing the
    Lean-Agile Enterprise flow of value via one or more Value Streams.
-   The portfolio helps to develop systems and solutions which are
    described in strategic themes (links a SAFe portfolio to the
    changing business strategy of an enterprise).
-   To meet strategic objectives, portfolio level encapsulates these
    elements. It provides basic budgeting and other governance
    mechanisms. This way it assures that the investment in the value
    streams provides the returns necessary for the enterprise.
-   A portfolio is connected to business bi-directionally:
    -   In order to guide the Portfolio to the larger changing business
        objectives, it provides strategic themes.
    -   Another direction indicates the constant flow of portfolio
        values.
-   Program Portfolio Management acts as stakeholders, and they are
    accountable to deliver the business results.
-   SAFe Portfolio Level contains people, processes and necessary build
    systems and solutions that an enterprise needs to meet its strategic
    objectives.
-   Value Streams are the primary objectives in Portfolio, with which
    funding for the people and other resources required to build the
    Solutions.
-   Important key concepts used here are:
    -   Connection to the Enterprise,
    -   Program Portfolio Management,
    -   Managing the Flow of Portfolio Epics.

### Working with Portfolio Backlog

Everything begins much earlier than the actual planning. In order to
work productively on the Commitment during the planning, you have to
have something to commit for. To ensure this, I have to "load" business
owners with work on probable initiatives (or, in SAFe terminology,
Epics, but hereinafter I'm going to use our usual term) as early as
possible. Ideally, this process should be completely divorced from the
iterative nature of quarterly planning and go its own Kanban way. We
took SAFe Portfolio Kanban as a basis:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/_p/qb/kj/_pqbkjcztxxv5drjbiubf8bkmgk.png)

We have a separate JIRA project with three issue types: Epics, Business
Initiatives and Architectural Initiatives; as well as the corresponding
Kanban Board. The algorithm for the Initiative's Business Owner is
simple: he adds an issue to this project, and it goes to Backlog by
default, which is the first status of our Kanban flow ---  **Funnel:**

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/nd/ha/f3/ndhaf3kb3ujmxj29j0qs6xpjzkc.png)

Here the Initiatives not yet ready for Review are stored. The Business
Owner works on the content of the Initiative until he feels ready for
the next step. The minimum required at this stage is to have filled-in
fields of Problem Statement, Desired Outcome and Measure of Success, as
well as a slightly more detailed, but simple and clear presentation. At
this stage it is important to leave aside technical solutions and focus
on business parameters. When all data is collected, Business Owner moves
the task to the next status ---  **Reviewing.**

We conduct Reviews on a weekly basis for both Business and Architectural
Initiatives. Ideally this is a five-minute presentation with subsequent
Q&As. As a result of the Review a decision is taken about what happens
to the Initiative next. It can:

-   be returned to Funnel for revision,
-   be abolished without a chance for further life (in this case I use a
    special  **Out-of-Date** status hidden on the Kanban Board),
-   be approved and moved to the next stage ---  **Analyzing.**

At this stage we --- Yippee!!! --- can finally engage IT guys: analysts,
architects, leads, anyone. By "we" I mean myself as a Release Train
Engineer. But ideally it should also be Business Owners, who have
already gained some experience and autonomy necessary for engaging the
right teams and independently launching analytics. Again, I am writing
about the ideal case here. In fact the level of self-organization of our
colleagues is floating, and in some cases they ask for help of a
specially appointed facilitator, but I try to step back from this
practice.

The purpose of this stage is preliminary analytics, or, as we call it,
Pre-discovery. As a result we should get a minimum that would allow us
to commit: proposed solutions, risks and dependencies, non-functional
and infrastructure requirements, user maps, architectural schemes. In
addition, we ask the teams to give a preliminary estimation in story
points at the feature level --- this will allow us to determine
priorities at the end of the quarter.

A personal Kanban Board is created at this stage for each Initiative, in
which features and stories can be seen, with a preliminary link to a
specific iteration, which is provided by a separate JIRA workflow. So by
changing the status we can assign the issue to some iteration. Swimlanes
in Kanban Boards are configured by development teams. Since our JIRA
ecosystem is rather complicated, during Pre-discovery and Discovery we
create tasks in separate projects in order not to litter the Teams'
backlogs:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/ug/sq/be/ugsqbekca0gmm_r3qy6q4rl1_sc.png)

Also at the Pre-discovery stage, we involve Architects or, as it's been
often practiced lately, their trusted people --- "EA Ambassadors". Their
task is to convey the vision of the architectural department to all the
participants, to help find the best solution, and finally to approve
this solution with the company\'s Head of Enterprise Architecture.
When all the people involved believe that the Initiative has been
analyzed enough and is ready for the next step, it is moved to the next
status ---  **Portfolio Backlog.**
At this stage it is important to conduct a WSJF prioritization (
[Weighted Shortest Job
First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_job_next#Weighted_shortest_job_first)).
To do this, we have a big meeting 3 weeks before the planning, which,
unfortunately, up to now has always lasted many hours. During this
meeting members of the Management Board evaluate the Business Value,
Time Criticality, Risk Reduction and Opportunity Enablement with the
help of Fibonacci-aligned planning poker:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/oa/uu/tf/oauutfrn4oy4gmj_iex_mzcgrno.png)


To be able to track the history of Initiatives, for each of them I add a
label in JIRA with quarter data: 2018Q4, 2019Q1, etc.
Looking ahead, let me describe all the possible statuses. After the
final commitment at PI Planning, Initiatives successfully taken into
work are moved to the  **Implementing** status, while those 'not fitted'
receive  **Parked** status and might be considered for the next
quarters. Delivered initiatives are moved to the  **Done** status.
As a result, we have the following picture on the Kanban Board:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/jj/ww/ov/jjwwovbdgbyuddjwmnv9fzb3gza.png)


Of course, we are not even in the middle of our way yet, but at the
moment I can already note that thanks to the Portfolio Backlog
implementationBusiness owners have begun to work through their
Initiatives in detail and thoroughly prepare for the Review.

-   The Reviews have become more meticulous in a good way.
-   Teams have more time for Pre-discovery.
-   I do not lose old Initiatives --- I can always go back to the
    Parked, not delivered or forgotten Initiatives and work on them
    further.

#### Tools used at this stage: 

-   Atlassian Jira Software Server
-   Plugin Colors for Jira --- for highlighting Business and
    Architectural Initiatives
-   The ' *Structure --- Project Management at Scale*' plugin --- to
    visualize the structure made of Initiatives and features belonging
    to them, and their WSJF prioritization
-   Atlassian Confluence --- source of internal documentation
-   Lucidchart and its plugins for Jira and Confluence --- for diagrams
    drawing

### Preparation for PI Planning

A month before PI Planning is when the busiest time comes. Too many
things need to be taken into account, and in order not to leave anything
out, I have to create a multipage "logistic" Google Form. Let me
describe the most important tabs from this Form and the activities
around them.
**Feedback.** A few days after each PI Planning we conduct a
Retrospective, which helps us not to forget what conclusions we came to
and how we need to adjust the course. This is an important part in terms
of continuous improvement.
**Technical preparation.** With transition to remote planning, specific
requests have appeared, such as quality of Internet connection
(prioritization and optimization of routes for JIRA and Confluence) and
video- and audio presence (we use the Logitec Group kits, Jabbra
microphones and personal headphones in various combinations, webcams,
Zoom software for video conferencing).
**Facilitators.** It's a list of employees responsible for facilitation
in each of the working groups, indicating their location and a link to
the permanent Zoom-channel of the working group.
**Audience.** The complete list of all invitees.
**Checklist.** The full list of important tasks with deadlines and
responsible persons. To give you some insight below you can find several
examples of the most typical and vital tasks relevant for each PI
Planning: training of Facilitators (a training manual has been prepared
with all the necessary steps such as organizing a working team, timing
the meetings and decomposing the Initiative into a list of features);
update of working groups' location plans for each office; control of the
Velocity update for all development teams; ordering meals; creating
reports from previous quarters; printouts of lists of Initiatives and
schedules.

### PI Planning and the process of Commitment

After all the preparatory running around, this moment finally comes ---
the start of PI Planning. In two days we have to discover all
Initiatives, make sure that the information is sufficient and commit.
After a few pep talks the working groups go to their places and get to
business. At the moment the number of groups is distributed among the
three offices as 4x4x2, and remote users are connected to the required
group via a dedicated Zoom channel.
Upon completion of the Discovery on each of these Initiatives, the
facilitator makes sure that all the necessary data, such as Acceptance
Criteria, technical solution, risks, dependencies, the necessity of a
new infrastructure, is available and marks the Initiative with the 'IT
Session Finished' checkbox for easy tracking of the progress. After that
the working group can move on to the next Initiative.
After a dozen of PI Plannings the feeling of being under constant stress
and time pressure, which was with us from the very beginning, has
significantly faded, and now it's all more like work as usual. In the
afternoon on the first and second days of the Planning it's the time for
unhurried commitment according to priorities. To perform a commitment, I
have several separate structures. The first one is a structure
containing a list of features and stories scheduled for the commitment:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/jw/b9/du/jwb9dufutnxjl0cceuedtqdigcc.png)


Unfortunately, this structure on the screenshot contains only tasks that
did not fit into the commitment of the current quarter, so the sample is
unrepresentative. In any case, in the search field I can select the
Initiative needed in order of priority by number, which is put in a
separate field for each feature and story, change the issues' status
from Planned to Committed and put them to the desired iteration, thereby
committing for them:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/ux/i5/hs/uxi5hsw4ahbf4vqtvse03x0z2mc.png)

As a result, the issue will disappear from this structure and appear in
a new, which reflects the growing commitment:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/6q/qh/af/6qqhaf8c7gsne22kaw78jfaw9xe.png)

As you can see on the screenshot, in this structure the stories fall
into the folder of the development team to which they belong and are
grouped by iteration. Here, I see the total Velocity of the team in the
folder name, and in addition in the Commitment column, the over
commitment is automatically determined and highlighted for each team, by
using a custom formula.\
Of course, if the first and highest priority Initiatives are included
into a commitment mostly easily, soon, as more and more teams fill their
backlogs to the end, there could be respective problems with some of the
initiatives, after certain arguments and discussions, being postponed
(parked) as a result.\
At the end of this rather straightforward process the teams swear to
deliver their commitment on the company\'s flag (ok, not really) and
hurry to their homes (well, again, not really, mostly they flee to some
bar to celebrate).

#### Tools used at this stage:

-   Atlassian Jira Software Server
-   The 'Structure --- Project Management at Scale' plugin -- to monitor
    the Discovery process and during the execution of the commitment.

Cloning issues into the working JIRA ecosystem of the Company
-------------------------------------------------------------

While everyone is drinking, the RTE is working on creating commitments
in the form in which it could be distributed to the development teams'
backlogs and monitored throughout the quarter. To do this, I use the
\'Bulk Clone Professional for Jira\' plugin --- it adds an item doing
collective cloning to the Bulk Change menu and has such necessary
features as links cloning, updating links between newly created clones,
updating Epic links, adding Summary prefix and automatic labeling:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/pp/5u/j7/pp5uj7lre2_7zsogsv7mgp_d2fw.png)


I add status as a prefix, because at the planning stage the statuses
reflect the planned iteration of completion. As a result I can see right
away in the Summary when we are planning to finish the feature or
story.
At first, I clone absolutely all issues into a separate Global Backlog
project, since we keep epics in it, and I need to have actual epic-story
connections in newly cloned tasks. And already as a second step, I make
JQL-requests for each development team separately and move the stories
into the working projects of the teams.
As a result, I create a structure that reflects the current Commitment
and consists of final stories, which I then use for monitoring:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/9y/xa/ep/9yxaeplzfj05z1sgqydu8w4j4dy.png)

In general, the advantages of this approach are the following:

-   It is easier for an IT guy to type new features and stories rather
    than to write them down with a highlighter on a sticky note.
-   Many things, such as capacity remains and WSJF update depending on
    the stories estimations, are calculated automatically using custom
    formulas.
-   Thanks to cloning, the original Commitment is preserved for history
    and we can always return to it.
-   It saves us both time and energy at the stage of planning
    preparation --- paper handling takes energy.
-   Of course, it's great that we no longer need to add issues to JIRA
    by typing in sticky notes.

#### Tools used at this stage: 

-   Atlassian Jira Software Server
-   The ' *Bulk Clone Professional for Jira*' Plugin-- for cloning
    features and stories into working JIRA projects.
-   The ' *Structure --- Project Management at Scale*' plugin -- for the
    creation of the final Commitment structure.

Program Levels
--------------

The Program Level contains the roles and activities needed to
continuously deliver solutions via an Agile Release Train (ART).
The program level is where development teams, stakeholders, and other
resources are devoted to some important, ongoing system
development mission. The ART metaphor describes the program level teams,
roles, and activities that incrementally deliver a continuous flow of
value. ARTs are virtual organizations formed to span functional
boundaries, eliminate unnecessary handoffs and steps, and accelerate
value delivery by implementing SAFe Lean-Agile principles and practices.
Although it is called the program level, ARTs are long-lived and,
therefore, have a more persistent self-organization, structure, and
mission than traditional programs which usually have definitive start
and end dates, as well as temporarily assigned resources. The ARTs
operating at the Program Level are ultimately responsible for creating
and releasing value in flow at the frequency needed by the enterprise to
meet market and customer demand. The mindsets and practices in this
level contribute to the enterprise competency of DevOps and Release on
Demand that makes this flow of value possible.

-   In Program level, Value of SAFe is delivered by long-lived Agile
    Release Trains (ART). Iteration is for team and train is for the
    program.
-   Agile Release Trains (ART) is the primary vehicle for value delivery
    at the program level. It delivers a value stream to the
    organization.
-   The Program Increments (PIs) duration is of 8 to 12 weeks.
-   ART is of 5 - 12 Agile Teams (~50 -- 125+ people) which includes
    all the roles and infrastructure needed to deliver fully tested,
    working, system-level software.
-   Each PI is a multiple-Iteration time box. During which a
    significant, valuable increment of the system is developed and
    delivered.
-   In each PI a "demo" and "Inspect and adapt" sessions will
    happen, and Planning begins for the next PSI.
-   At the Program level, SAFe emphasis on the principle of alignment.
    This is because multiple agile team efforts are integrated to create
    customer value.
-   SAFe artifact hierarchy is  **Epics->features->user stories**.
-   At a Program level, Product Manager/Program Manager has content
    authority. He defines and prioritizes the program backlog.
-   Program backlog is a prioritized list of features.
-   At the program level, features can be originated, or they can derive
    from epics defined at the portfolio level.
-   Features decompose to user stories and flow into team-level
    backlogs.
-   Product Manager or the Release Train Engineer role could be handled
    by the Program Manager/Senior Project Manager
-   System Architect role at the program level is to collaborate day to
    day work with the teams. It ensures that non-functional requirements
    are met. Also, they work with the enterprise architect at the
    portfolio level to make sure there is sufficient architectural
    runway to support upcoming user and business needs.
-   Interface design, user experience guidelines and design elements for
    the teams are provided by UX Designers.
-   Chief-Scrum Master role is played by 'Release Train Engineer'.
-   Various team (from marketing, development, quality, operations, and
    deployment) forms 'Release Management Team'. They will approve
    routine releases of quality solutions to customers.
-   Deployment of software into customer environments and successful
    delivery is taken care of by DevOps team.

Team Level
----------

![](https://lm2jj13uhv2157rey3v60xm8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Keystone-TTA-WEB-1.png)

The Team Level contains the roles, activities, events, and processes
which Agile Teams build and deliver value in the context of the Agile
Release Train (ART). Teams are the foundation of SAFe and the Lean
enterprise, as they perform the clear majority of the work that delivers
customer value. SAFe's Team Level describes how to create
high-performing teams that create high-quality components and solutions,
supporting both team agility and technical agility. While depicted
somewhat separately in the 'Big Picture,' the SAFe team level is a vital
part of the Program Level. All SAFe teams are part of an ART---the
primary construct of the program level.

Each agile team is responsible for defining, building, and testing
Stories from their Team Backlog. Using common Iteration cadence and
synchronization, the teams align to a series of fixed-length Iterations
to make sure the entire system is iterating. Teams use ScrumXP or Kanban
to deliver high-quality systems, routinely producing a System Demo every
two weeks. This ensures that all teams in the ART create an integrated
and tested system that stakeholders can evaluate and respond to with
fast feedback.

                                               \* Team Kanban


-   All SAFe teams are part of one or other Agile Release Train (ART).
-   SAFe teams are empowered, self-organizing, self-managing,
    cross-functional teams
-   Each team is equally responsible for defining, building and testing
    stories from their Team Backlog in a fixed-length Iterations
-   Teams plan and execute two-week time-boxed iterations in accordance
    with agreed-to Iteration Goals.
-   Teams will use ScrumXP/Team Kanban routine to deliver high-quality
    systems to produce a System Demo on every two weeks.
-   All different teams in the ART (Agile Release Trains) will create an
    integrated and tested system. Stakeholders will evaluate and respond
    with fast feedback
-   They apply Built-in Quality practices.
-   Each ScrumXP team will have 5-9 team members, which includes all the
    roles necessary to build a quality incremental value in each
    Iteration.
-   ScrumXP roles includes:
    -   Team(Dev+QA)
    -   Scrum Master
    -   Product Owner. Etc..
-   SAFe divides the development timeline into a set of iterations
    within a PI (Program Increment).
-   ~~PI duration is between 8 -12 weeks.~~
-   The team will use stories to deliver the value. The Product Owner
    will have content authority over their creation and acceptance of
    the stories.
-   Stories contain Customer\'s requirements.
-   Team Backlog includes user and enabler stories, which are identified
    during PI planning. When the Product Management presents the
    Roadmap, Vision, and Program Backlog.
-   Identifying, elaborating, prioritizing, scheduling, implementing,
    testing, and accepting the stories are the primary requirements of
    management work in team level.
-   Each iteration provides:
    -   A valuable increment of new functionality
    -   Accomplish via constantly repeating pattern
    -   Plan the iteration
    -   Commit to some functionality
    -   Execute the iteration by building and testing Stories
    -   Demo the new functionality
    -   Retrospective
    -   Repeat for the next iteration
-   Teams also support the System Demo at the end of each Iteration.
    which is the critical integration point for the ART.
-   Larger Value Streams will have multiple ARTs.
-   The Innovation and Planning (IP) Iterations leverage the teams with
    an opportunity for innovation and exploration.

Value Stream Level
------------------

Value Streams represent the series of steps that an organization uses to
build Solutions that provide a continuous flow of value to a customer. A
SAFe portfolio consists of a set of development value streams, each of
which builds and supports one or more solutions. The primary role of a
SAFe portfolio is to fund and nurture a set of development value
streams. These value streams either deliver end-user value directly or
support internal business processes. Organizing around value streams
offers substantial benefits to the organization, including faster
learning, shorter time-to-market, higher quality, higher productivity,
and leaner budgeting mechanisms.  In SAFe, organizing around value is
accomplished by first understanding value streams and then launching
Agile Release Trains or Solution Trains to fulfill them. Realizing value
streams via trains is the 'art' and science of SAFe. Furthermore, value
stream mapping can be used to identify and address delays and
non-value-added activities to accomplish the Lean-Agile goal of the
shortest sustainable lead time.

-   The Value Stream Level is optional in SAFe.
-   Value Stream Level is new in SAFe 4.0.
-   The Value Stream Level is intended/designed for Enterprises
    /builders/organization who are:

1.  1.  1.  Large in size
        2.  Independent
        3.  Have complex solutions
        4.  Their solutions typically require multiple ARTs
        5.  They have Suppliers contribution.
        6.  They face the largest systems challenges
        7.  For cyber-physical systems
        8.  For software, hardware, electrical and electronics, optics,
            mechanics, fluidics and more.

-   Building this kind of systems often takes hundreds, even thousands
    of practitioners, external and internal suppliers.
-   If the systems are mission crucial. Failure of the Solution, or even
    a subsystem, has unacceptable economic and social consequences.
-   If the Enterprises can be built with a few hundred practitioners, it
    may not need the constructs of this level. In that case, they can
    use from the \' **collapsed view\'** which is 3-level SAFe.
-   Building value stream solutions in a Lean-Agile pattern requires
    additional artifacts, coordination, and constructs. So this level
    contains an Economic Framework to provide financial boundaries for
    Value Stream
-   It supports cadence and synchronization for multiple ARTs and
    Suppliers. It includes Pre-and Post-PI Planning meetings and
    Solution Demo.
-   It gives additional roles which are: Value Stream Engineer, Solution
    Architect/Engineering, and Solution Management.

The Lean-Agile Leadership
-------------------------

This competency describes the approach that Lean-Agile leaders should
take in driving and sustaining organizational change. The Lean-Agile
leaders help to achieve operational excellence by empowering individuals
and teams.

They learn, exhibit, teach and coach SAFe's Lean-Agile values, mindset,
principles, and practices to help everyone reach their greatest
potential.

The organization's managers, leaders, and executives continuously
improve the system that governs the work performed.

The leaders enable high performing agile teams that create value and
flourish. The main aspects of Lean-Agile Leadership are:

Lean-thinking managers-teachers 
-------------------------------

These are the people who understand Lean at a deeper level and teach it
as part of their daily activities.

Leading the transformation {#SAFe(ScaledAgileFramework)-Leadingthetransformation}
--------------------------

The Lean-Agile leaders guide their organization through the Scaled Agile
Framework transformation. They outline at each step, where they are,
where they should go next and why it is important to continue the
transformation.

Team and Technical Agility
--------------------------

### Team Agility 

The agile teams that have skills to define, build, test and deploy value
in short iterations.  These Agile teams use a blend of methods such as 
[Scrum and Kanban.](https://reqtest.com/agile-blog/scrum-vs-kanban/)

The Agile teams collaborate in an organizational construct called the
Agile Release Train (ART). The ARTs bring together all the people who
define, build, test, and deploy a solution.

### Technical Agility

The Technical Agility defines the agile software engineering principles
and practices that the teams use to deliver reliable solutions quickly.

Lean-Agile values and principles, eXtreme Programming (XP) practices, 
[Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development),
Agile modeling, built-in quality, proven approaches and patterns for
object-oriented software design are part of Technical Agility.

DevOps and Release on Demand
----------------------------

This competency outlines how the principles and practices of DevOps
provide the enterprise with the capability to release value at the time
necessary to meet market and customer demand.

DevOps aligns development, operations, business, information security,
and other areas to work together better by sharing responsibility and
improving business results.
