Agile : Prioritize the Backlog 
==============================


![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*Rr0UVQNsb6EXVsKp)

Agile teams rely on a prioritized backlog to guide their work. The most
important work is at the top of the list, available for the team to
start as soon as they are ready. Less important work is ranked lower,
and is elaborated only when it moves near the top of the list. As new
work comes in that needs to be done, the product owner adds it to the
backlog in the appropriate position so that the team always knows what
work to start next.



When to Prioritize
==================

-   Rank the backlog continuously
-   Once you have committed to an iteration plan, you should not change
    the rank of those committed items
-   All other items can be re-ranked whenever you learn new information,
    usually in the form of feedback or information gathered from the
    team or stakeholders

Techniques for Prioritization
-----------------------------

-   The product owner must rank the backlog, deciding which story is
    first, which is second, which is third, and so on
-   Initially prioritize backlog items using a bucket scheme such as
    MoSCoW ( *must have, should have, could have, won\'t have*)
-   Subsequently, you can individually rank each item in the backlog, so
    that the team can always start the prioritized stories
-   If a story contains various components that can be prioritized
    differently, consider breaking it down into multiple child stories

Consider the following when prioritizing:

-   The value of the feature for the masses
-   The value of the feature to a few of the elite
-   Story cost
-   Estimated time to implement
-   The impact it has on other stories
-   Risk and opportunity costs

Art of Dicision Making
----------------------

People always have questions and concerns about Risk management and
Autonomy in the Scrum Team, like:

-   How do we make sure the success of the product if the Product Owner
    is new or hasn't had enough domain knowledge yet? How does the
    Product Owner make the right decision, which is business value in
    20% needs to do first will bring the 80% outcome for the product?
-   The Autonomy of the Development Team can lead to many risks behind
    that. So, how can the Development Team know what to do to create
    Done Increment and also can mitigate the risks?

That concern is reasonable when you manage the risk by "Command and
Control." Your organization built by a hierarchical structure, where the
need for the carefulness and details plan is required to make sure no
risk or issue happens, or at least in the list of "Risk Control" Sheet.
That is not the wrong thing, and risk management is necessary.

But when you are facing uncertainty, the changes happen anytime, can't
be predictable, but you need to move faster than your competitors, so
you need something different from the hierarchy. Because hierarchy can
help you safe but not moving quicker, and be more flexible. Team-based
make a decision based on layer or need to go thought the silos to take
action. This structure makes the organization lost the chance to
communicate with the consumer on time.

[Empowering and supporting the team to be self-organized can be helpful](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/why-does-scrum-team-need-self-organization)
. It creates flexibility and creativity from the team, who can
communicate with consumers directly every day, can make a decision but
still have a clear boundary. Or shortly, self-organizing with a clear
boundary will help you to be more flexible.

Scrum can give you that value. By creating the space for the Scrum Team
to work, learn, improve, and make the right decision to increase the
value of the product. Helping team works smarter, not harder:

1.  By ordering the Product Backlog, and understanding at the top of
    backlog is the most value PBIs can be developed in the next Sprint.
    The Product Owner can say "No" with waste and focus on defining and
    building the correct benefits for the consumers. This helps to avoid
    to fail in "The Undisciplined Pursuit of More".
2.  Remember that we are facing the complexity, where we know is less
    than unknown, and can not make sure what is right. Therefore, the
    small loop of Sprint is important to help us manage the risk. If we
    fail, we fail fast, and the cost is low. The small circle also helps
    us have the momentum of learning from the failure. From that, the
    Scrum team can define the next step, or change the plan to make the
    next decision better.
3.  The events in Sprint create the chance to inspect and adapt; it has
    a time-box; this helps the team has official opportunities to review
    the plan to reach the Sprint Goal.
4.  The Sprint Goal gives the team a clear direction, the north star,
    keep for team do not lose the focus, from that they can well-manage
    their plan, result in the problems, to achieve the goal.
5.  Time-box helps the team focus to have the solution and have a
    decision as best as they can in the current situation, rather than
    waste time into the lengthy discussion or the meeting but have no
    value. 
6.  On top of that, Scrum does not ask to remove the hierarchy structure
    in your current organization when applying it. To make it happens,
    ingenuity is required in balancing the two structures at the same
    time, and the Scrum Master role is necessary. The Scrum Master will
    support the Development Team, the Product Owner, and the
    Organization to apply Scrum and optimize Scrum value to  [ensure the trust between teams](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/build-trust-scrum)
    ;  [transparency is always kept](https://www.scrumviet.org/blog/empiricism-transparency-dont-left-it-behind) so
    that the Scrum Team can have self-organizing to make the right
    decisions, what to do and when is the best time.
