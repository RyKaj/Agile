Agile : Product Roadmap 
=======================

A product roadmap is a plan of action for how a product or solution will
evolve over time. Product owners use roadmaps to outline future product
functionality and when new features will be released. When used in agile
development, a roadmap provides crucial context for the team\'s everyday
work, and should be responsive to shifts in the competitive landscape.
Multiple agile teams may share a single product roadmap.

As a Product Owner, you are responsible for Product Backlog management,
stakeholder management and forecasting. Therefore, you will probably use
a variety of tools and techniques to track progress, manage expectations
and keep people informed. One of the tools that may come in handy for
you is a product roadmap. Applying product roadmaps effectively can be
challenging however. The concept of a product roadmap however, is that
it is a high-level, strategic plan, that describes the likely
development of the product over the next period of time. The roadmap
should support the products\' purpose and vision and it helps the
Product Owners to keep their stakeholders aligned. The roadmap
also makes it easier to coordinate the development of different products
and it fosters transparency in order to manage customer expectations.

Building the Roadmap
====================

To build a roadmap,  [product owners](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management) take
into account market trajectories, value propositions, and engineering
constraints. Once these factors are reasonably well-understood, they are
expressed in a roadmap as initiatives and timelines. Below is a very
simple roadmap for a product team. The initiatives are in blue and
timelines are indicated by the milestone-markers in red.

Sharing the Roadmap
===================

Once a roadmap is built, it needs to be shared with the entire product
team so everyone understands the vision and direction.

Before we talk about dynamic forecasting solutions, let\'s talk about
the steps to build a long-term agile plan using the metaphor of building
a house:

-   What are the relative priorities of each initiative?
-   When do we intend to work on each initiative?
    -   Are there particular dates the team needs to hit?
    -   What dependencies does the program have--either internal, or on
        other teams
-   Which [teams](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/teams) are
    working on each initiative?
    -   Do the current teams have availability in their schedules and
        enough capacity?
    -   Can we keep the current agile teams stable?
        -   If not\...
            -   How will teams be re-organized?
                -   Are we accounting for ramping-up newly-formed teams
                    in the project\'s timeline?

Sharing the Roadmap
-------------------

### Using Roadmap 

It\'s important to link your team\'s work back to the roadmap so you get
that whole \"context\" thing I mentioned above. A tried-and-true way of
doing this is to break initiatives down into 
[epics](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics-stories-themes) in
the product backlog, then further decompose them into 
[requirements](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/requirements) and
user stories. Tying it all together like that makes it easier for
product owners and the development team to make near-term decisions that
don\'t compromise future work. Let\'s look at an example to see how this
plays out.

Say, for instance, that we roll out an extensive user profile feature on
our website. If we find that our customers don\'t engage with the
feature, should we continue to invest in it? Maybe, maybe not. We need
to understand why engagement is low before we make this decision. So
instead of pressing forward, we might opt to implement some A/B tests in
the hopes of gaining some insight on the low engagement rate--which may
point us in a direction that would have been far more difficult (or
impossible) had we simply plowed ahead adding more bells n\' whistles.

The ability to take a step back and research before we make a pivotal
decision is the essence of an agile roadmap. It gives the team the
ability to evolve features as they learn more about a product, and the
market. Anti-patterns to watch out for

-   Future planning is completely ignored --- we\'re shootin\' from the
    hip!
-   The \"rest of the business\" is kept in the dark as to what the team
    is up to.
-   The roadmap is continuously updated (or never updated).
-   Detailed requirements are weighing down the roadmap.

### Story Map 

![](http://burozeven.nl/robbinschuurman/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/StoryMap-300x212.png)

The story map is a really nice type of roadmap that I often use in the
beginning of new projects or products. The story map is an excellent way
to create a nice overview of all the features you and your stakeholders
can think of, which will be important to your product. Although the idea
is not to create an unlimited list of all the features and
functionalities that will likely be developed somewhere in the future,
it does provide a nice starting point to facilitate creative ideas for
your product. What I like most about the story map is that it provides
an overview of all the user activities that need to be covered by the
system, which in turn enables you to create small and valuable user
stories, which can be developed and delivered incrementally and
iteratively.

Another aspect I like a lot about the story map is that it starts with
the user activities, and thus taking a users\' perspective on the
product. I really like this concept, since it helps you
with brainstorming about the product from a users\' perspective, after
all, we develop our products for our users and customers right?

The main downside of the story map that I\'ve seen in practice is that
it creates the illusion that all the features for the product will be
developed. Since we\'re being Agile, it is **not** our goal to create a
complete plan or breakdown for the product, so my advice is to use the
story map at the start of your new product development project, but also
make it very explicit to stakeholders that you will not neccesarily
develop all of the stuff in your story map. So manage these expectations
well!

Evolving the Roadmap
--------------------

Waterfall projects require a huge upfront investment. As a result, team
members become emotionally attached to the roadmap and sacrifice making
the right decision because it\'s too painful to undo the work they have
done--a \"human\" sin, if ever there was one.

For it\'s part, agile development runs into three different risks:

-   The team may lose confidence in the ability of the leadership to
    make strategic decisions if the roadmap is updated too frequently.
-   The product might arrive too late on the market and miss out on
    pent-up demand if the roadmap is not updated frequently enough.
-   Long-term efforts can seem \"too big and too difficult\" for shorter
    iterations. The team over-compensates by breaking the work down into
    powder-fine granularity, and ends up focusing too heavily on
    short-term results.

To combat \"thrashing\", staleness, and nearsightedness, keep the
roadmap evenly focused on short-term tactics and strategic, long-term
goals. A great way to do this is to review roadmaps quarterly, adjust as
needed, and share. This works well in any size organization, but
remember: a single roadmap can span multiple agile teams, so inspect,
adapt, and communicate accordingly.

### Tips for Agile Product Roadmaps

I hope these different roadmap types are useful for you, but remember:
\"Being Agile is not about processes and tools but about individuals and
interactions\". Therefore, and thanks a to [Roman
Pichler](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/) for
offering some inspiration, I would like to share the following 11
tips with you about creating Agile product roadmaps:

1.  Start with your product vision (tip: use [Roman\'s Product Vision
    board](http://www.romanpichler.com/tools/vision-board/));
2.  Describe and validate your [product strategy](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/);
3.  Focus on goals and benefits, by creating a [goal oriented product roadmap](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/) (or
    one of the other types I\'ve explained before);
4.  Tell a coherent story about the likely growth of your product and
    don\'t oversell it;
5.  Keep it simple! Resist the temptation to add too much details to
    your roadmap;
6.  Actively collaborate with stakeholders to ensure buy-in;
7.  Have the courage to say no, to prevent an overload of features in
    your roadmap;
8.  Think twice about adding timelines, dates or deadlines to your
    roadmap;
9.  Make sure your roadmap is measurable, by adding measurable goals and
    KPI\'s;
10. Create a rough estimate for each feature (\#people + required
    skills) to determine the viability of a feature;
11. Review and adapt your product roadmap on a regular basis.
