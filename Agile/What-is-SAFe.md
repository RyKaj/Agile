Agile : What is SAFe 
====================

SAFe
----

The Scaled Agile Framework is a framework that provides four different
layers of agile-lean adoptions.

Scaled agile framework abbreviated as SAFe is a framework of proven,
integrated principles, practices and competencies for Lean, Agile, and
DevOps.  SAFe is a scalable and configurable framework that helps
organizations in  [scaling
agile](https://reqtest.com/agile-blog/scaling-agile-reqtest/) and
lean.

![SAFe](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/SAFe.png)
<img src="./attachments/471992239.png" alt="">

Scaled Agile Framework addresses the problems encountered when scaling
agile beyond a single team.  SAFe promotes collaboration, coordination,
and delivery across a large number of agile teams. This framework
leverages three primary bodies of knowledge:

-   Agile software development
-   Lean product development
-   System thinking

Scaled Agile Framework SAFe, is a freely available online knowledge base
that allows you to apply lean-agile practices at the enterprise level.
It provides a simple, lightweight experience for the software
development team. The whole framework is divided into three segments 
**Team, Program and Portfolio**. We will see this in detail later on

-   Implementing Lean-Agile software and systems in enterprise level
-   It\'s based on Lean and Agile principles.
-   It gives detailed guidance for work at the enterprise Portfolio,
    Value Stream, Program, and Team.
-   It\'s designed to meet the needs of all stakeholders within an
    organization.

SAFe was first developed in the field and was elaborated in  **Dean
Leffingwell\'**s books and blog. Version 1.0 is the first official
release in 2011. The latest version is 4.6, was released in October
2018. It provides guidance to work at enterprise Portfolio, Value
Stream, Program, and Team levels.

These five competencies are:

1.  **Lean agile leadership:** Leaders should drive and support
    organizational change and operational effectiveness. Ultimately, it
    is the leadership team that has the authority to influence
    individuals and teams to achieve their potential.
2.  **Team and technical agility:** Teams must possess certain vital
    skills and adhere to Lean agile practices to create well-designed
    solutions quickly. Ensuring the technical agility of teams is
    especially important as they are the ones who ultimately perform the
    actual work that will be delivered to your customers.
3.  **DevOps and release on demand:** The establishment of a continual,
    ongoing pipeline for deliverables is vital for creating value to
    meet your customers' needs.
4.  **Business solutions and Lean systems engineering:** The more
    organizations facilitate Lean agile practices to drive blueprints,
    development and deployment, the more innovative they can be.
5.  **Lean portfolio management:** A sound organizational strategy that
    includes financial considerations, portfolio management and
    compliance-related aspects is essential to SAFe success.

### When to Use Scaled Agile Framework 
-   When a team is interested to implement an agile approach
    consistently across larger, multi-team programs and portfolios.
-   When multiple teams are running their own way of Agile
    implementation but regularly facing obstacles, delays, and failures.
-   When teams want to work independently.
-   When you want to scale Agile across the organization but not sure
    what new roles may be needed or what existing roles (i.e.,
    management) need to change and how.
-   When you have attempted to scale the Agile across your organization
    but struggling in alignment to achieve uniform or consistent
    strategy across business departments from portfolio to program and
    team levels.
-   When an organization needs to improve its product development lead
    time and want to know how other companies have succeeded in scaling
    Agile with SAFe.

### How different than other Agile practices 

-   It\'s publicly available and free to use.
-   Available in a highly approachable and usable form.
-   It\'s lightweight, practically proven results and specific to level.
-   It constantly/regularly modifies/maintains most commonly used agile
    practices.
-   Offers useful extensions to common agile practices.
-   Grounds agile practices to an enterprise context.
-   Offers complete picture of software development.
-   Visibility or transparency is more on all the levels.
-   Continues or regular feedback on quality and improvement.

SAFe Formation
--------------

Let\'s start our discussion on Scaled Agile Framework and its formation.
By now, we have clearly articulated and understood the need to have a
Scaled Agile Framework in an organization.

Now, conceptualize an environment where we have multiple teams working
under similar conditions to achieve the same objective. It is time for
us to move ahead and see how Agile Scaled Framework such as Scaled Scrum
works in this space.

-   All the stakeholders (Internal or External) and management come
    along together to create a very high-level Portfolio Vision Document
    which is also called as Portfolio Backlog. Portfolio Backlog is
    essentially consisting of multiple Business and architectural
    requirements which is also known as Epics. These business and
    architectural epics are aligned with priorities.

![Epic](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/Epic.png)

-   Based on the priorities, these epics are picked up by the Product
    Managers/Delivery Managers. They create a well-defined Roadmap and a
    Vision Document. They do this activity by discussing the release
    plan with the Release Management Team to align the roadmap with the
    production releases.
-   Once the Roadmap and Vision Document is created, the Product
    Manager's next step is to create a backlog of Program Backlog. A
    Program Backlog consists of Release Items, Functional bits and a
    pool of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs).
-   The Release Management Team prepares a release plan to fit in the
    features in the release cycles.
-   The Release Management Team now works on the feature bits to fulfill
    the Release Plan and objectives. They also work on preparing the
    architecture and infrastructure to enable smooth releases.
-   From the Program Backlog, we move towards an individual Product
    Backlog which is also known as Team Backlog. Release/System Team
    have their own Product Backlog, similarly, all the Scrum Team
    working on the project will have their individual Product Backlog.
-   Product Backlog consists of both functional and non-functional
    stories. These stories are prioritized by the Product Owner who is
    working on that Scrum Team.
-   Typically there are 5-10 Scrum Teams that are working in a Scaled
    Agile Environment. Each of the Scrum Team has a Product Owner, Scrum
    Master, and a Development Team. The roles and responsibilities of
    each of the Scrum Team Member in Scaled Scrum are the same as that
    in the normal Scrum Environment.
-   The Scrum Team performs all the Scrum Ceremonies and works on
    developing the Increment to be delivered at the end of each sprint.

### Core Values 

Alignment, Built-in Quality, Alignment and Transparency

-   Communication and Collaboration between the Scrum Teams is the key
    to a successful Scaled Scrum in terms of productivity, quality and
    time to market.

A few tweaks here and there in a Scrum Framework can lead to incredible
results in the form of Scaled Scrum.

![Core Value](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/Core-Value.png)

SAFe Configuration
------------------

The below image explains how agile process works. Epics are a large body
of work, which is further broken down into a number of smaller stories
or sub-epics. These sub-epics are allocated to the team as a story. Each
team then work on these stories or software features accordingly. SAFe
supports the full range of development environments with four
configurations,

![SAFe Configuration](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/SAFe-Configuration.png)
<img src="./attachments/471992241.png" alt="">

### 1. Essential SAFe 

-   The Essential SAFe configuration is the heart of the Framework and
    is the simplest starting point for implementation.
-   It's the basic building block for all other SAFe configurations and
    describes the most critical elements that are required to realize
    the majority of the Framework's benefits.
-   The Team and Program Levels form an organizational structure called
    the Agile Release Train (ART), where Agile teams, key stakeholders,
    and other resources are dedicated to an important, ongoing solution
    mission.

### 2. Portfolio SAFe 

-   The Portfolio SAFe configuration helps to align portfolio execution
    to the enterprise strategy.
-   Organized around the flow of value.
-   Lean-Agile budgeting empowers decision makers.
-   Kanban system provides portfolio visibility and WIP limits.
-   Enterprise architecture guides larger technology decisions.
-   Objective metrics support governance and improvement.
-   Value delivery via Epics.

### 3. Large Solution SAFe 

-   Large Solution SAFe configuration is for developing the largest and
    most complex solutions that typically require multiple Agile release
    trains and Suppliers, but do not require portfolio-level
    considerations.
-   This is common for industries like aerospace, defense, automotive
    etc.
-   The Solution Train organizational construct of the Large Solution
    Level helps enterprises that face the biggest challenges---building
    large-scale, multidisciplinary software, hardware, and complex IT
    systems.
-   Building these solutions requires additional roles, artifacts,
    events, and coordination.

### 4. Full SAFe 

-   The Full SAFe configuration is the most comprehensive version of the
    Framework.
-   It supports enterprises that build and maintain large integrated
    solutions, that require hundreds of people or more, and includes all
    levels of SAFe: team, program, large solution, and portfolio.
-   In largest enterprises, multiple instances of various SAFe
    configurations may be required.

Foundation
----------

The Foundation contains the supporting principles, values, mindset,
implementation guidance, and leadership roles that are required to
deliver the value successfully at scale.

<img src="./attachments/471992242.png" alt="">

Lean-Agile Leaders 
------------------

Management has the ultimate responsibility for business outcomes.
Leaders must be trained, and then become trainers of, these leaner ways
of thinking and operating. To this end, SAFe describes a new style of
leadership that is exhibited by the enterprise's leaders.

Lean-Agile leaders lead his\\her Organization in building better systems
through iterative and incremental ways of learning, coaching, developing
people and processes.

![SAFe Lean-Agile
Leaders](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/SAFe-Lean-Agile-Leaders.png)

SAFe Lean-Agile Leaders are lifelong learners and teachers who help the
teams to build better systems through understanding and exhibiting the
Lean-Agile Mindset and SAFe Principles

Core Values 
-----------

Four core values define the belief system for SAFe:

### Program Execution 

-   Program execution is the most important core values as it compares
    to other values without which the execution team cannot deliver any
    value to the customer.
-   Mainly it focuses on working software and great customer experience.
-   Complex software development is accomplished with the help of
    inspecting and adept at the end and performs better in every PI.
-   Not only the teams but with the help of Agile leaders, the
    leadership team can also perform customer satisfaction

### Transparency 

-   At every level i.e. team, program, value stream, and portfolio level
    we have a whiteboard which displays information about project
    progress at any point of time.
-   The team follows agile scrum, hence all the team members trust each
    other and are free to take decisions which foster innovations.
-   Encourages open and honest communication with all stakeholders.
-   Value productivity, quality, transparency, and openness over
    internal politics.

### Built-in Quality  

-   Incrementally adopt the Built-in Quality practices for software,
    hardware, and firmware. Understand, teach, or sponsor technical
    skills development in support of high-quality code, components,
    systems, and solutions.
-   Foster Communities of Practice.
-   Understand, support, and apply Agile Architecture and Lean User
    Experience (UX)

Lean-Agile Mindset  
------------------

### SAFe Manifesto

These basic principles and values for SAFe must be understood, exhibited
and continued in order to get the desired results.

-   Take an economic view
-   Apply systems thinking
-   Assume variability; preserve options
-   Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles
-   Base milestones on an objective evaluation of working systems
-   Visualize and limit WIP, reduce batch sizes and manage queue lengths
-   Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
-   Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
-   Decentralize decision-making

Lean-Agile Leaders are lifelong learners and teachers. They understand
and embrace Lean and Agile principles & practices.

![Lean-Agile mindset](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/Lean-Agile-mindset.png)

**Our Lean-Agile mindset is represented in two things:**

**(i) The House of Lean:**

The House of Lean is the one which you see here.

**It has a number of elements:**

**Value,** as the goal of Lean is very simple, it has the shortest
sustainable lead time. That\'s accomplished by the pillars of  **respect
for people and culture**, product development flow,
innovation---critical to long-term sustainability---and relentless
improvement. And it\'s supported by  **leadership**.

That\'s the structure in which we tend to think about the Lean paradigm.

Everything else is the same as Agile Manifesto

### Agile Manifesto

>     “agile” is a state of being, not a process. It is a feeling that drives development and delivery. In teams I would consider agile, none of them operated exactly like the others; and some actions that would improve agility in one team would harm it in another. Some companies are able to mimic that feeling by embracing agile principles, and others aren’t. The important part isn’t the specific methodology that others say will help you achieve max productivity for your team, it’s the process that aligns with your culture and your software and your customer.

Agile  
-----

Agile is an umbrella term used to describe a project management
methodology which breaks down large complex projects into smaller
manageable chunks. Agile project management has been used in software
development to speed up the completion of projects, but now, we see
these practices being applied in a multitude of industries. \"

[Agile is a set of guiding principles developed in 2001 published as
the ] [[Agile
Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)] [.
Scrum and Kanban, on the other hand, are two methodologies which are
considered to be Agile. Or to put it another way, if you want to work in
an agile fashion, Scrum and Kanban are two ways to do it.]"
said Nicholas Carrier, Associate Partner at London-based 
[Prophet](https://www.prophet.com/) .

A structured and iterative approach to project management and product
development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and
provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change
without going off the rails. Today, agile is hardly a competitive
advantage. No one has the luxury to develop a product for years or even
months in a black box. This means it's more important than ever to get
it right.

Agile software development is based on an incremental, iterative
approach. Instead of in-depth planning at the beginning of the project,
Agile methodologies are open to changing requirements over time and
encourages constant feedback from the end users. Cross-functional teams
work on iterations of a product over a period of time, and this work is
organized into a backlog that is prioritized based on business or
customer value. The goal of each iteration is to produce a working
product.

In Agile methodologies, leadership encourages teamwork, accountability,
and face-to-face communication. Business stakeholders and developers
must work together to align the product with customer needs and company
goals.

### Agile Manifesto

*We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and
helping others do it.*

*Through this work we have come to value:*

***Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools*

***Working software** over comprehensive documentation*

***Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation*

***Responding to change** over following a plan*

*That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the
items on the left more.*

Human Resource Manifesto
------------------------

We follow these principles:

Support people to engage, grow,

and be happy in their workplace.

Encourage people to welcome change

and adapt when needed.

Help to build and support networks of empowered,

self-organising and collaborative teams.

Nourish and support the people's and team's motivation

and capabilities, help them build the environment they need,

and trust them to get the job done.

Facilitate and nurture personal growth,

to harness employee's different strengths and talents.

12 Principles
-------------

1.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
    continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile
    processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3.  Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a
    couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4.  Business people and developers must work together daily throughout
    the project.
5.  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the
    environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job
    done.
6.  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to
    and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors,
    developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace
    indefinitely.
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
    enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is
    essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
    self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
    effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Agile Leadership
----------------

1.  When there are leadership and guidance, not command & control.
2.  When there is alignment across the organization instead of the
    pursuit of local optimization efforts or personal agendas.
3.  When the collaboration of all participants beyond hierarchies is the
    norm, not an exception.
4.  When we acknowledge that management principles of the 19th century
    are unsuited to solve complex problems of the 21st century.
5.  When managers become servant leaders.

The following paragraphs focus on the main concepts related to agile
leadership: from servant leadership to the agile mindset to creating a
learning organization. The lists are not supposed to be comprehensive
but provide the interested reader with a starting point for further
research.

### Servant Leadership

"A Servant Leader shares power puts the needs of the employees first and
helps people develop and perform as highly as possible. Instead of the
people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the
people."

Source:  [Wikipedia on Servant Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership "Wikipedia on Servant Leadership").

Servant leadership is a suitable approach to dealing with complexity.
Complexity --- the unknown unknowns --- determines decision-making
processes and is characterized by:

-   More unpredictability than predictability.
-   Emergent answers.
-   Many competing ideas.
-   Cause and effect can only be determined in retrospect.

For a much more elaborate approach to complexity, see the  [Cynefin
framework by Dave
Snowden](https://cognitive-edge.com/ "Agile Leadership: Cynefin framework").

Servant leadership is not a new concept:

"A leader is best when people barely know he exists when his work is
done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves." ( [Lao
Tzu, 4th century
BC.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi))

Servant leadership is characterized by:

-   Service to others.
-   Promotion of community.
-   Creation of a shared vision.
-   A holistic approach to work.
-   A shared decision-making process.

Servant leadership thus seems suited to overcome the industrial
paradigm. Source: 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership "Wikipedia on Servant Leadership").

### Intent-based Leadership

The principles of intent-based leadership according to David Marquet are
as follows:

-   Create leaders, not followers.
-   Resist the urge to resolve the problems of your people.
-   Take deliberate action.
-   Learn everywhere at any time.
-   Specify goals, not methods.
-   Don't empower, emancipate.

Agile Mindset
-------------

As to what "having an Agile mindset" means, things were initially
unclear. Some resorted to the Supreme Court's approach to defining
pornography: "You know it when you see it." Yet over time, the nature
and content of the Agile mindset have clarified, particularly by way of
contrast to the  *bureaucratic mindset* that is still prevalent in many
large organizations.

Practitioners are thus said to have  *an Agile mindset* when they are
preoccupied---and sometimes obsessed---with innovating and delivering
steadily more  *customer* value, with getting work done in small
self-organizing  *teams*, and with collaborating together in an
interactive  *network*. Such organizations have been shown to have the
capacity to adapt rapidly to a quickly shifting marketplace.

The bureaucracy that ensues from such a mindset often finds it hard to
adapt to a world in massive rapid change.

The two different kinds of mindsets exert a powerful influence on the
behavior of their respective organizations and can be seen as having
the  *de facto* force of organizational laws, as shown here.

![The Agile mindset vs the bureaucratic
mindset](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fstevedenning%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F08%2Fmindset-table.jpg)

It's not that those with a  *bureaucratic mindset* don't care about the
customer: it's just that they generally focus more on making money for
the company and its shareholders. Nor do they never use teams; it's that
in a bureaucracy, self-organizing teams are the exception, not the rule.
Nor is operating as a network unknown in a bureaucracy: it's just that
maintaining the pyramid of layers and divisions is seen as more
important.

A bureaucratic mindset, when shared by tens of thousands of staff, tends
to create a radically different---and less adaptable---kind of
organization than one peopled by those with an Agile mindset.

Agile As A Professional Mindset  
-------------------------------

It may be better to think of the Agile mindset as something akin to the
mindset of a profession, such as that of a lawyer, a doctor or an
economist. Thus, lawyers, doctors, and economists think about certain
problems in characteristic ways. They notice certain kinds of
information, data, and concerns in their respective subjects. They
analyze the issues in their respective ways. They pursue their
respective kinds of solutions. These different ways of thinking,
perceiving and acting as lawyers, doctors, and economists, are acquired
over years of training and practice, which in turn generate
characteristic attitudes, values, modes of thought and approaches to
problems. Professional mindsets are not things that can be acquired
overnight or a two-day training course.

Similarly, those managers with an Agile mindset also pay attention to
certain kinds of information, data, and concerns. They analyze problems
in particular ways. They tend to pursue certain kinds of
solutions---focusing on value for customers, working in small teams and
operating as a network. Their ways of thinking, perceiving and acting
are often acquired over a period of years of practice. We should not be
surprised that the Agile mindset too isn't something that can be
acquired overnight or a two-day training course.

What we are talking about with the Agile mindset is the emergence of
management itself---finally---becoming a real profession.

The Nature Of The Agile Mindset  
-------------------------------

The Agile mindset is an attribute of practitioners more than theorists.
It is pragmatic and action-oriented more than a theoretical philosophy.
It goes beyond a set of beliefs and becomes a tool for diagnosis and the
basis for action. It tends to be built on the hard-won knowledge of
experience and crafted from the lessons of trying to cope with massive
change in the face of incomprehensible complexity.

The Agile mindset might also be called a framework, a paradigm, or a
common model. Yet "mindset" seems a better choice of word, reflecting a
coherent tradition of exploration, paths of analysis and patterns of
reasoning.

The Agile mindset reflects ways of thinking that have developed over
time. It is a certain cast of mind that emphasizes some things over
others. It should continue to grow and evolve. It reflects attitudes and
viewpoints that tend to endure. Over time, it leads to people being seen
as having a certain makeup or character. Once we have understood the
Agile mindset, we can anticipate types of behavior that should occur.

The 'agile mindset' discussion seems to be centered around five areas:
complexity and planning, delivering value, self-organization, fostering
collaboration, and cross-functionality of teams:

### Mindset, Complexity, and Planning

-   The definition of mindset: " [The established set of attitudes held
    by
    someone](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mindset "The Oxford Disctionaries on Mindset")."
-   The complexity challenge:
    -   The  [scientific management
        methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management "Wikipedia on Scientific Management") of
        Frederick Taylor does not apply to "creative work."
    -   Problem-solving in a complex environment cannot be achieved with
        "more" planning.
    -   The future in the complex or chaotic domain cannot be predicted.
    -   Hence different approaches need to be employed when dealing with
        creative solutions in unchartered territory, for example, 
        [Empiricism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/empiricism "The Encyclopedia Britannica on Empiricism") or 
        [Lean](https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/).

### Focus on Delivering Value

-   Continuous value delivery to customers; outcome over output.
    (Manifesto of Agile Software Development: " [Working software is the
    primary measure of
    progress](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html "Principles behind the Agile Manifesto").")
-   Continuous learning & applying empiricism:
    -   Deming:  [PDCA
        cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA).
    -   Empiricism: Transparency, inspection, adaptation.
    -   Iterative, incremental.
    -   Accepting that failure is more than an option but inevitable.
    -   Willingness to adapt to change.

### Self-Organization

-   Teams can best decide how to accomplish work and achieve the goal.
-   Teams outperform individuals.
-   Team building is a crucial success factor: The team wins, the team
    fails.
-   [Optimize for flow not
    utilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CostXs2p6r0),
    and move from push to flow.
-   The importance of values:  [courage, commitment, focus, openness,
    respect](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#values "The Scrum Guide on Scrum Values").

### Fostering collaboration

-   Creating psychological safety and equal speaking opportunity.
-   Respect for individuals.
-   Inclusion and diversity.
-   [Core
    Protocols](https://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/ "Jim and Michele McCarthy: The Core Protocols"):
    Opt-in, opt-out, law of 2 feet --- creative work requires voluntary
    participation.
-   Prime directive: stop protecting the organization by assuming people
    come to the office to "rip you off."
-   [Give people a voice, provide an opportunity to be
    heard](https://management30.com/podcast/the-secret-to-creating-high-performing-teams/).

\[NYTimes.\]

### Cross-functional Teams

-   End-to-end (value) delivery capability of teams.
-   The autonomous pursuit of customer value balanced with
    accountability.
-   Abandoning functional silos in favor of focusing on delivering
    value.
-   Avoidance of local optimization.
-   A cornerstone on the path to achieving business agility.

MIT Sloan School of Management and coined the term 'learning
organization' in his book ' [The Fifth
Discipline](https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Learning-Organization/dp/0385517254/ref=sr_1_fkmr2_1 "Peter Senge: The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization"):'

-   " [The only sustainable competitive advantage is an organization\'s
    ability to learn faster than the
    competition](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/21072.Peter_M_Senge "Peter Senge on the Learning Organization")."
-   "People working together at their best. It's a continuous,
    relentless process."
-   There are two mindsets that can infiltrate an organization: control
    and learning.

These are the characteristics of a learning organization according to
Peter Senge:

-   System thinking: assessing businesses as a system of bounded
    objects.
-   Personal mastery: the commitment of an individual to the process of
    learning.
-   Mental models: assumptions and generalizations held by individuals
    and organizations.
-   Shared vision: Creating a collective identity to provide focus and
    energy for learning.
-   Team learning: The accumulation of individual learning.

Harvard Business School professor David A. Garvin defines a learning
organization as follows:

-   "A learning organization is an organization skilled at creating,
    acquiring, and transferring knowledge, and at modifying its behavior
    to reflect new knowledge and insights."
-   New ideas, insights or moments of creativity are necessary to
    trigger organizational change. They are not sufficient, though to
    create a learning organization. The changes to the way work are
    accomplished need to follow suit.

Traditional vs. Agile Leadership Behaviour - A Cheat Sheet
----------------------------------------------------------

We can aggregate and condense the before mentioned concepts and
principles into a comparison of the traditional management style and
agile leadership:

### Traditional Management \<=\> Agile Leadership

1.  Predictive, long-term planning \<=\> Provision of vision, strategy,
    and direction
2.  Control of work, task assignment \<=\> Fostering self-organization
3.  Maximize utilization and capacity \<=\> Supporting teams by removing
    what is impeding them
4.  The go-to problem fixer for subordinates \<=\> Let those closest to
    the problem figure out a solution
5.  Motivating others by extrinsic incentives (bonuses, titles, etc.)
    \<=\> Motivating others by enabling autonomy, mastery, and purpose
6.  Information flows up the hierarchy (reports, meetings) \<=\>
    Management moves to where the information is, for example, by
    participation in Sprint Reviews.

### 4. SAFe Principles

SAFe practices are grounded in nine principles that synthesize Agile
methods, Lean product development, systems thinking, and decades of
field experience.

1.  Take an economic view
2.  Apply systems thinking
3.  Assume variability, preserve options
4.  Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles.
5.  Base milestones on an objective evaluation of working systems
6.  Visualize and limit WIP, reduce batch sizes, and manage queue
    lengths
7.  Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
8.  Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
9.  Decentralize decision-making

### 5. Implementation Roadmap 

Implementing the changes that are necessary to become a Lean-Agile
technology enterprise is a substantial change for most companies. SAFe
provides an implementation roadmap to help or guide organizations on
this journey.

Finally, let\'s discuss implementation. We\'ll describe that using our
Implementing SAFe 1-2-3 model.

Number 1 is to train the Lean-Agile change agents. We call those SAFe
Program Consultants. With a sufficient staff of Lean-Agile change agents
onsite, and working with your partners, you\'ll have the ability to
train the executives and leaders and managers who are the people
responsible for managing the people who deliver value.

They\'ll then be in a position to support the launch of the Agile
Release Trains. And with one train at a time, you\'ll build that Agile
portfolio.

Conclusion
----------

**SAFe **is a framework which gives us alignment not only with the
team(lower level) and program level but also helps us align to with
organization strategy(top level) and how a team's works in adding value
to customers right from the top level.

It is available in different configurations, and companies can take
advantage of it

It can be used by a big organization, and it has got a good feedback
from companies implemented in it, it has got it of rules, values and
principle's if used correctly, the organization can make customer
delighted and produce software in a shortest sustainable lead time which
adds value.
