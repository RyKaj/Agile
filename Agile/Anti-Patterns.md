Agile : Anti-Patterns 
=====================

Anti-patterns are common solutions to common problems where the solution
is ineffective and may result in undesired consequences.  An antipattern
is different from bad practice when:

-   It is a common practice that initially looks like an appropriate
    solution by ends up having bad consequences that outweigh any
    benefits
-   There's another solution that is known, repeatable, and effective.

The concept of anti-patterns was inspired by the concept of design
patterns, which indicate common effective solutions to common problems.

Anti-patterns were initially applied in the context of software
development, but have extended to other aspects of software engineering,
organizations, and project management.

Coaches and consultants like to invoke anti-patterns as a way of
pointing out behavior they often see in teams they coach and as an
avenue of suggesting better patterns.

Agile anti-patterns is also referred to as Fake Agile or Dark Scrum .

General ( Fake Agile )
======================

Fake agile is a type of waste. It's a broken process.

When teams are churning out a higher amount of working builds with the
intention of facilitating customer feedback, there is going to be a lot
of waste; a lot of stuff that *just doesn't hit the mark*.

Whether it's due to heavy-handed management undemocratically forcing
their agile agendas onto developers who just aren't ready for it, or
well-meaning project leads seeking to improve the productivity of their
team by implementing a hot new methodology, the root of fake agile is a
system that isn't performing as well as it could be.

More specifically, fake agile is fake because it's not truly upholding
the principles of agile. Fake agile is sugar-coating (rebranding)
traditional methodologies like waterfall with jargon.

This mismatch is called fake agile. What's so bad about it?

Well, let's look at some common beliefs of teams championing a so-called
agile approach:

-   "We're so much more productive now that we're agile!"
-   "People over processes!"
-   "Working software is more important than documentation!"
-   "Adaptiveness and resourcefulness are more valuable skills than your
    ability to stick to a plan!"

While there is truth in these statements, many agile implementations
twist them into a crude half-truth that lacks the vital life-force that
every agile team needs -- a proper understanding of the why behind
agile.

Gabrielle Benefield gives a clear explanation of the dangers of crude
agile approaches in her GOTO conference, titled *Frankenbuilds; if Agile
is so good, why are our Products so bad?*.

I'd recommend the whole talk, but to summarize, her point boils down to
the oversimplification of agile into a system which prioritizes quantity
over quality.

She argues this crude "machine gun agile" approach that pressures teams
to push out more regular working builds to increase the odds of getting 
*something* right creates a lot of waste.

To better understand the danger of a misguided fake agile approach,
consider this example.

Imagine a project manager that has just announced during the daily
stand-up that, thanks to their new agile approach, the team has
successfully delivered 35 features, on-time and on-budget.

Impressive-sounding statistics, but who is going to use those features?
How will they help the company provide more value to customers, and make
more money? Why 35 features? Could the same result have been achieved
with two or three features?

Fake agile is "building the wrong thing righter". It doesn't matter
whether you're using kanban, scrum, or a home-grown bespoke framework if
you're not building the right thing to begin with.

Fake Agile versus True Agile
----------------------------

![fake agile timeline](https://www.process.st/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fake-Agile-Timeline.png)


 ||True Agile|Fake Agile|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Ignoring Users|Developers understand the importance of communicating and involving customers and users with the development and development process. They will share development progress and actively seek feedback in order to improve the process or product.|Developers are not interested in communicating with real users of the application (program testing and evaluation don’t count); if there is feedback, it is not continuous (only happens at the start of the project, for example).|
|Time Management and diminishing returns|Prioritizes working builds and understands the importance of rapid iteration. New working builds either weekly or at least at the end of each sprint.|Attention to requirements over quickly deploying something useful. Rarely has a working build ready to show at the end of a sprint; working build is pushed to the hardening sprint or “next sprint”.|
|Responsibility|Developers are active and willing to take responsibility for their role in providing the customer with value, and improving upon their offering.|Developers defer responsibility and act like “it’s not my job”.|
|Streamlined Processes|Processes are automated as much as possible to eliminate tedious manual tasks and focus on providing value to the customer|Processes are mostly manual; lots of scope for automation.|
|Importance of functionality|Focus on iterative development of working software, where feedback from key stakeholders is crucial at every step.|Focus on compliance and requirements where working software is a nice bonus that is normatively pushed back to “another sprint”.|
|Misguided Agile Leadership|Agile is different because the nature of responsibility is fundamentally different. Individuals in a high-performing agile development team should have a shared sense of responsibility.|A common theme with this problem is the idea that there must be a “single throat to choke”. This is expected in traditional development structures, where the project manager is essentially responsible for making sure each member of the team is getting their work done.|
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+


Product owners and scrum masters are there to fulfil key roles like
reporting back to business owners and communicating with stakeholders,
but their roles are fundamentally different to a typical project
management position.

![scrum team agile](https://www.process.st/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Scrum-Team-Agile.png)

This difference in managerial approach also highlights the difference in
attitude towards punishment and fear in the workplace environment.

If individuals are afraid of the punishment they'll see if they fail,
their creativity and innovation is quashed. This kind of fear
doesn't motivate; it simply drives numbers and discourages
experimentation.

Fear of punishment also pushes people away from responsibility. If your
team knows they will be scalded if they don't perform, they will
inevitably fail more because individuals will spend more of their energy
avoiding accountability rather than focusing on doing their best work.

The two different mindsets have the de facto force of organizational
laws

Leadership Is Not Championing Agile Principles
----------------------------------------------

As with most transformations in corporate environments, their success or
failure is often singlehandedly determined by leadership and culture.
Even more so with Agile. Agile is a new philosophy that requires a
different management approach and set of behavior. Leaders can't just
employ their old tried-and-tested techniques to apply Agile.

It is often the case that leaders don't take the time to understand and
immerse themselves in what Agile is as a philosophy, culture, and way of
operating. Going into this thinking that this is "just another way of
doing project management," is a recipe for failure. They won't be able
to exhibit the right behavior themselves -- nor drive the right behavior
in the organization. Only if the leaders of an organization truly want
to become Agile, and foster the right atmosphere, will the seeds of
Agile take root. This means realizing that they are on the same learning
journey as their teams, changing their leadership style and championing
Agile culture from the top.

### A Few Tips to Get Started

#### Let Go of Traditional Management Philosophies

Leaders need to let go of their traditional ways of managing, such as
command and control, and truly embrace servant-leadership. To achieve
impact and win the trust of their teams, leaders must become
approachable problem solvers, whose main priority is to facilitate teams
and continuously remove impediments.

#### Actively Support New Ways of Working

Another important role-modeling behavior in Agile transformations is
allowing agility in delivering work. If you continue to seek
project-based outputs, and demand extensive plans and approval gates --
this doesn't really show a willingness to change the way of working.
This will again result in traditional waterfall processes.

#### Build Credibility in The Subject

Leaders should focus on displaying a healthy level of knowledge on the
transformation topics. This can help to gain the trust of their teams as
well as building credibility. To do so, it is important that leaders do
keep up with theory, training, and news on relevant subjects.
Furthermore, they should be actively involved in the \"learning by
doing\" process of the team to increase understanding.

Driving Transformation as A Top-Down Initiative
-----------------------------------------------

Successful transformation cannot be achieved by imposing it on people.
Forcing people to "do Agile" is the antithesis of the very same Agile
philosophy that values the autonomy of the individual. One of the
principles of the Agile Manifesto is:

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment
> and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

To build this motivation and two-way trust, your teams need to
understand why they need to work differently, what's in it for the
organization, and what's in it for them. Without this being clearly
articulated and reinforced, you will be fighting an uphill battle.

### A Few Tips to Get Started

#### Tell the Story so People Understand and Believe in It 

There is a reason why your organization is embarking on this journey.
Maybe a new digital competitor is disrupting your industry and you need
to speed up delivery to catch up. Or you may have an exciting new
product or business model that you need to launch quickly. Or you may be
getting poor customer feedback and need to react. No matter what the
reason is, your teams need to understand it and believe in it.

Don't underestimate the value of storytelling as it creates a much more
emotional reaction than facts and figures, and helps individuals feel
personally invested in the outcome. A good story is also more easily
shared and commonly owned by a group of individuals, which helps with
alignment. We suggest spending time working on the narrative: why is
your transformation important? How will individuals contribute to your
success? What does the happy ending look like? Keep telling the story
over and over again so it seeps into the consciousness of the business.

Anti-Patterns: Organization - Leaddership - Culture
===================================================

Not Communicating Expectations
------------------------------

Agile leaders tend to have a clear idea of what they think needs to
happen for an organization to succeed. They often develop a
comprehensive strategy with that vision in mind and delegate key tasks
across a variety of teams to achieve those goals. Once these initiatives
are in place, agile leaders oversee implementation and troubleshoot
problems as they emerge. It's a great approach that perfectly defines
the role of the agile leader. Except it often doesn't work that way.
Agile leaders have a specific perspective on the problems they're trying
to solve. They understand the overall purpose of each initiative and how
specific tasks relate to each other. Sometimes, that information isn't
adequately communicated to team members who are pursuing those goals.
Agile leaders cannot assume that people automatically know what is
expected or why it is important. The key problem with people not knowing
what's expected of them relates to accountability. If someone doesn't
have a clear idea of what they're supposed to do or what "good" work
looks like, agile leaders will not be able to set them up for success or
hold them accountable if they fail to deliver. By clearly establishing
expectations and making sure that team members understand what they're
doing and why it's important, agile leaders will not only promote better
accountability but also drive engagement and keep people inspired.

Not Using Failure as a Learning Opportunity
-------------------------------------------

The danger of being forward thinking is not taking the time to look
back. Agile leaders excel at finding solutions to problems, even
problems of their own making. Sooner or later, even the best agile
leaders will make a mistake. Dealing with the consequences of that
mistake is only part of the equation, however. Once the problem is
resolved, it's important to understand what went wrong in the first
place to ensure it doesn't happen again.

Agile leaders need to make a habit of reviewing their miscues to
determine whether or not they were part of a larger pattern or an
isolated incident. Reviewing available data and gathering feedback are
crucial steps in this process. Without this reflection, agile leaders
may downplay the importance of previous mistakes and move on to the next
challenge rather than holding themselves accountable. Over time, this
can undermine trust and credibility, especially if team members come to
believe that accountability is a one-way street.

Adapting Too Quickly
--------------------

In the heat of the moment, it can be tempting to take some action---any
action---for the sake of doing something. Change flexibility and
adaptability are, after all, hallmark traits of agile leaders. When a
strategy doesn't seem to be working out the way they planned, their
inclination is to change course quickly.

But patience is often a virtue. Agile leadership isn't about making
decisions purely on instinct. Effective agile leaders understand that
decisions made without sufficient data or feedback are likely to be
guided by biases and assumptions. While they may not have as much
information as they would like, gathering data can help them assess the
problem accurately and develop better solutions as a result.

Agile leaders must also have the foresight to determine whether the
challenges they're facing represent a short term issue or a long term
one. Especially during change initiatives, staying the course to see a
strategy through may be the best choice.

Fear of Failure
---------------

One of the most difficult tasks agile leaders face is making decisions
that have a great deal of risk associated with them. While organizations
often talk about promoting risk taking as a way of encouraging new ideas
and innovation, the consequences of failure usually end up falling on
leaders who are willing to take those chances. However, without a
process to manage the risks associated with their decisions, these
leaders are ultimately held accountable for the consequences.

Because agile leaders understand the inter-relationship between
different areas of their organizations, they may hesitate to make a
decision they know will create disruption. Sometimes, though, these
changes are necessary for the organization to become more agile and move
forward. Driving innovation, for instance, might be worth disrupting
certain processes if the long term benefits justify the choice. Putting
off those hard choices for fear of negative consequences can be even
more detrimental than the consequences themselves in the long run.

Becoming Reactive Instead of Proactive
--------------------------------------

Agile leaders are valued for their adaptability and change flexibility,
but these qualities should never be considered a substitute for
strategic thinking. Effective agile leaders must be able to respond
quickly to change, of course, but one of the ways they do so is by
anticipating future needs and potential outcomes behind every decision

Understanding how different aspects of an organization are connected
allows them to anticipate how changes in one area of operations will
affect another. This helps them to take a proactive approach to
challenges, laying the groundwork for future decisions rather than
constantly reacting to the crisis of the moment. Responding to problems
as they emerge is a valuable skill, of course, but relying on those
leadership qualities too heavily will make it difficult to develop a
long-term vision for achieving organizational goals.

Agile leaders are critical to the success of any organization. Their
ability to connect, adapt, and deliver allows them to strike an
effective balance between immediate needs and future goals. Even so,
these highly-adaptable leaders must be on guard against habits that
could diminish their effectiveness.

Budgeting process as a stage gate to exercise control through the back door
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The budgeting process is hard to align with agile requirements like the
longevity of teams. Hence, the original process will have to change over
time. However, it is a sign of mistrust, though, if the management uses
the budget permanently as a means of controlling the teams, making them
"pitch" every two months or so. There is absolutely nothing "agile" to
be found in this practice. Instead, the management ought to provide the
teams with goals and guidance how to achieve these along with funding
that is sufficient to meet the objectives.

\"Where is my report\"
----------------------

The manager expects to receive reports regularly instead of
participating in ceremonies, for example, the stand-ups or the
sprint/iteration reviews. A quick look at the Manifesto for Agile
Software Development should help the manager, though: ' [Individuals and interactions over processes and tools](http://agilemanifesto.org/ "Agile Management Anti-Patterns: The Agile Manifesto")'
is a core principle of all agile practices.

Steering meetings
-----------------

Unimpressed by the agile ways of working, the manager insists on
continuing the bi-weekly steering meetings to ensure that the team will
deliver all her requirements in time. This one has a quick remedy,
though: just do not participate in meetings that have no value for the
team.

Disrupting the flow
-------------------

The manager disrupts the flow of the scrum team by inviting random team
members to various meetings of little or no value, or by disrespecting
time-boxes of scrum ceremonies, or the sprint/iteration itself. Scrum
master, you will need to intervene in this case.

Bulding or ReAssigning Team Members
-----------------------------------

The manager decides who is joining or leaving the team without involving
the team itself in the decision process. Building a high performing team
is not accomplished by moving FTEs from one spreadsheet to another.
There is a reason why special forces, for example, put so much effort
and time into the longevity of teams and any agile organization should
follow the example. The least the manager can do is involve the team in
all decision that may affect the team composition. Known as Peer
Recruiting.

The management regularly assigns team members of one scrum team to
another team. (Scrum can only live up to its potential if the team
members can build trust with each other. The longevity of teams is hence
essential. Moving people between teams, on the contrary, reflects a
project-minded idea of management. It also ignores the preferred team
building practice that scrum teams should find themselves. All members
need to be voluntarily on a team. Scrum does rarely work if team members
are pressed into service. Note: It is not an anti-pattern, though, if
two teams decide to exchange teammates temporarily. It is an established
practice that specialists spread knowledge this way or mentor other
colleagues.)\

Hardening Sprints
-----------------

While the idea of continuous delivery is to permanently provide more
value to customers by frequently shipping new code, it is fine to
continue thinking in releases. There may be legal reasons for that, or
customer care and sales need to be thoroughly trained in advance, or the
customers prefer it this way. What is not acceptable in an agile
engineering organization, though, is preserving QA as a separate, siloed
entity that demands time for end-to-end testing before releasing any new
code. That is true cargo cult agile. Instead, move the QA engineers into
the scrum teams and focus on test automation and other well-established
CD practices.

----------------------------------

1.  Controlling inputs Over Controlling outputs/outcomes
2.  Micromanagement Over Macromanagement
3.  Taking sides Over Serving the whole team
4.  Meetings Over Actions & resolutions
5.  Certification Over Qualification

Cargo-cultism
-------------

This is the least mature of these destructive behaviors whose concept
and name is derived from a 1957 article by Judy Inglis in Oceania titled
" [*Cargo Cults: The Problem of Explanation.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40329058?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
"

Refactored for Agile,  [cargo cultism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) is a
belief system among relatively inexperienced software development
organizations characterized by the blind inclusion of artifacts and
activities without understanding the reasons behind them.

How do you know if you're part of a Cargo-cult?

One example might be the insistence of a four-hour Sprint/iteration
planning session for a two-week Sprint/iteration for no other reason
than the Scrum Guide suggests " *Sprint/iteration Planning is time-boxed
to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint*/iteration" as if the
time box facet of this gathering is the key to planning success.

Another example might be organizing only in 6 member developer teams ---
regardless of need --- because the Scrum Guide suggest " *Fewer than
three Development Team members decrease interaction and results in
smaller productivity gains ... Having more than nine members requires
too much coordination*" as if splitting the difference is the key to a
highly effective team.

Hyperscumdamentalism
--------------------

Second on the Agile immaturity anti-pattern scale, 
[hyperscrumdamentalism](https://deanondelivery.com/you-might-be-a-hyperscrumdamentalist-if-b90be353b42b) differs
from cargo-cultism in that it afflicts experienced 
[Aglistas](http://www.agile-doctor.com/2011/07/25/attack-of-the-agilistas/) who
replace naiveté with religious zealotry.

For example, while hyperscrumdamentalists understand the reasoning
behind various actions and artifacts, they've lost their way in that
they now only see Agility happening through the devout practice of
Scrum. Some go as far as to call those engaging in Kanban, Crystal
Clear, or XP as heretics who should be shunned from any further contact
with their teams.

How do you tell if you've been afflicted with Hyperscrumdamentalism?
Here are just a few of the revealing symptoms:

-   You pitch a royal fit if a developer doesn't create a task in JIRA
    to fix a typo in a [README.md](http://README.md).
-   Your place blue painter's tape on the floor with team member's names
    on them so that stand-ups are consistent and orderly.
-   You hear yourself name-dropping '[Bob Galen](http://rgalen.com/)' or ' [Alistair Cockburn](https://alistair.cockburn.us/)' as one
    might cast a spell or invoke a magic incantation.
-   You find yourself in HR after freaking out because you ran out of
    powder pink PostIt notes used to demark a DevOps related story.

Command & Controlism
--------------------

This is yet another anti-pattern born out of equating Scrum to Agile,
only in this case, Scrum is employed as a power mechanism to crack the
whip. Sometimes it is the evolutionary result of unchecked
hyperscrumdamentalism, however, sometimes it's also born out of the
vestiges of ancient practices such as Waterfall and RUP.

Regardless of how it comes about, when it happens self-organization can
no longer occur because Scrum practices are refactored to optimize along
complete and total resource utilization. An example of this is found in
Ron Jeffries' blog post titled ' [Dark Scrum](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/016-09ff/defense/)'
where he writes:

" *Fortunately, Dark Scrum has power holders, Product Owners, and
stakeholders for this effort. They make sure the programmers are made
fully aware of how badly they've done. That will surely inspire everyone
to do better next time. To help with that, we have the Sprint/iteration
Retrospective!*"

What are some other signs of Command-and-Controlism?

-   Definition of Doneness that goes well past the recommendations of
    the Scrum Guide, and instead takes on the appearance of an  [IEEE Standard 830--1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification) Software Requirement Specification.
-   The insistence that multiple teams of varying skillsets and
    geography all size stories along a common standard; one that is
    usually based solely on time. Moreover, never, ever, EVER discuss
    nonsensical notions such as \#NoEstimates when it comes to story
    sizing.
-   The treatment of product roadmaps as [Gantt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) and [PERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique) charts, with supporting backlogs taking on the appearance of a [WBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure).

Agile Scapegoatism
------------------

The highest level --- or perhaps we should say lowest --- of failed
Agile-ism anti-patterns is the one that rears its ugly head to blame
others. Sometimes this is a result of an organization, teams, and/or
individuals having experienced its way through the prior three
dysfunctions. Sometimes it's just easier to toss Agile under the bus by
blaming it for systemic issues that are outside of the practice of 
[Lean, Design Thinking, Scrum](https://deanondelivery.com/product-manager-exercise-design-a-better-automated-teller-machine-71696c3ec8e0),
or any other associated framework or approach; such as  [pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, or gluttony](https://deanondelivery.com/productorio-the-seven-deadly-sins-of-product-management-fec848be7992).

Some examples include blaming agile when it's ...

-   ... the product person who fails to support the question " *What can
    be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming
    Sprint/iteration?*"
-   ... the team who fails to answer the question " *How will the work
    needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?*"
-   ... everyone who thinks it's someone else's job to write stories,
    test features, and/or facilitate rituals.
-   ... the stakeholders and sponsors who fail to equip their
    organization with the tools needed to " *... uncover better ways of
    developing software by doing it and helping others do it.*"

The only cure for this is to  [quit blaming the hammer](https://careersherpa.net/motivation-monday-dont-blame-the-hammer/) for those times you hit your thumb.

Retro Is An Actionable Solution That Should Be Observed
-------------------------------------------------------

This is one of the most common anti-patterns that I have observed. It\'s
normal that the management expects the people to learn based on the
experiences of their co-workers as they share in their \"recorded\"
retrospectives. But the problem here is that people are conscious about
what they share during this kind of meetings. Employees have a hard time
speaking up knowing that others will be listening to the recordings.
They might be afraid that people will see them differently if they
become honest and upfront with their ideas.

**Solution:**\
The company should be promoting the said concept as a comfort zone or
solution place for the employees where they can be comfortable to voice
out the problems that they encounter within the team. It should be a
safe place where employees feel free to speak out.

Change The World
----------------

We cannot create a dramatic change overnight. Although it\'s good to be
optimistic all the time, we should still be realistic in setting our
goals. It is essential to consider the timeline and the capability of a
person or a team to finish the tasks. If we set too high expectations
and goals, it may lead to disappointment and low morale of the
employees. Functions shouldn\'t be too overwhelming for the employees to
chew.

**Solution:**\
This is another common anti-pattern which has an easy solution. You can
improve simple things continually and consistently. Teams should do
things one step at a time especially if it\'s about the implementation
of certain changes on some long-time habits. Adjustments are hard in any
kind of situation. By taking steps slowly, people can stay focused on
the goal and will be able to have exemplary performance.

Progress Under Time Pressure
----------------------------

Some people can work better under time pressure others don\'t. For a
period of less than 10 minutes after iteration demo, the team will
discuss the circumstances in the workplace which they call a
retrospective. With this, the team doesn\'t see retrospectives as
beneficial. The participants might struggle to tool their solutions and
ideas if they don\'t have a room of supporters.

**Solution:**\
The leadership style of the Scrum Master in handling such situation is
imperative. The coach let the team understand the importance of what
Agile Retrospectives give. The coach can do this by facilitating a
workshop. The coach should remember the problems addressed. Constant
improvement or change of small things will be helpful for the team

No Accountability Is Claimed
----------------------------

Making sure that the team member knows their responsibilities is
essential. If not, there might be a lot of complications such as
conflicts between team members. Blaming each other will most likely be
the effect of that. So in Retrospectives, it should be clear from the
very start whoever handles which.

**Solution:**\
I would like to give to the group accountability. They should be the one
deciding on this matter since they will be the one acting on it. The
coach can ask them the question, \"How will you solve this dilemma?\"\
This question is direct to the point and will not cause any
misinterpretation. It means that they need to do something to make some
changes.\
It\'s normal to hear from them that they can\'t think of a way to solve
the problem, but don\'t let it stop you. Definitely, you can develop
solutions to the problems or come up with ideas to address the
challenges. Let them explore ideas but make sure that they don\'t resort
to complaining. Instead should be encouraged to think and act.

Wishful Thinking
----------------

For any discussion, it\'s important not to make the points vague. It
should be concise, and there should be owners of every idea presented.
The team should always engage in discussions. With this, they would
realise the things that they need to be able to install the
\"self-styled activities.\"

**Solution:**\
Classify the action items as \"done\" or pending. Refactoring is not
very helpful in this problem. It cannot measure if they finished the
task already. \"Develop Customer Experience evaluation from a failure to
a level higher\" is attainable thus the group can take simple tasks that
can help upgrade these metrics. You can base your actions on Airbrake,
New Relic, Airplane, Code Climate, or other equipment facilities in
achieving objectives for performance and quality.

Monitor Ideas To Action
-----------------------

This is about \"what went well and what needs improvement\", but none of
it was taken into an actionable solution. It will be difficult if the
team members will only discuss problems and not the action plans. They
need the action plans as their guide. It\'s not enough to think about
the causes of the problem. It\'s more important to understand the
situation and plan effective solutions.

**Solution:**\
There should always be one point person for every action item.
Preferable someone who could implement rules and look after the team
members. Accountability is important in every situation. Make a
checklist and check out the tasks that were already finished.

Everything should be clear, and it should be understandable to everyone.
Emphasize that Action Items remain actionable even if they were not
viewed right away.

No Evaluations Of Action Items
------------------------------

In whatever we do, it\'s important to review so we will be able to
assess the points that we need to improve. Analyzing past actions is one
key in determining the committed errors.

**Solution:**\
The first part of retrospective should always be the review. This is for
the team to check which Action Items has not yet been done. The team
should think of a Success Standards. They will then use this criterion
on the next retrospective.

Management Wants Involvement
----------------------------

There are times that the management wants to take part in
retrospectives. They mean no harm in doing this and definitely, they
would want to help out in coming up with the solutions. It\'s just that
this is not an ideal action. There are things that need to be discussed
by the core group and influence by outsiders may not be helpful at all.
As I\'ve said, people will not be comfortable having an outsider listen
to the discussion.

**Solution:**\
Scrum Masters should make a guideline that nobody but the handpicked
people can join retrospectives. The task of the Scrum Leader or Master
is to mention the topics to the management. But he still should observe
confidentiality.

Big Task Are Assigned To Scrum Master
-------------------------------------

Scrum Master should not be the problem solver. It\'s a common idea, but
people should stop believing this. The members should be the one solving
the problems.

**Solution:**\
One person cannot come up with a solution to every problem. That\'s why
the participation of every member is essential. Each person has a unique
style of thinking. With each other\'s help, they will be able to come up
with the best idea to solve the problem.

Team membership changes too frequently
--------------------------------------

Remember Tuckman's stages of group development --- forming, storming,
norming, performing? Time together and experience as a team makes a big
difference in a team's ability to predict what they can deliver in the
future. Over time, if we maintain the team membership and composition,
they get better at planning and execution. This is true even when they
are faced with new problems and challenges. There is a lot of value in
allowing a team to stabilize and not disrupt the membership. I realize
with hiring and attrition, nothing is ever perfect. But I've seen the
productivity difference in companies that value maintaining persistent
cross functional teams as opposed to those that constantly tweak and/or
launch new project/tiger/swat teams as short term accelerators. They may
gain some short term lift but over the long term, most large
organizations need to know how to deliver against a portfolio of work
that comprises the majority of their teams.

Moreover, once I have a team that is working well together, they usually
don't want to change.

Priorities shift often
----------------------

While it may seem obvious that in order to deliver on plans, we expect
them to largely stay unchanged, working in agile should create a healthy
tension on scope. Agile teams deliver the best results when they
consistently inspect and adapt with feedback. This sometimes translates
to a team facing feedback after every sprint, which may alter their
future direction. However, accepting or addressing feedback can be
different from "changing priorities". Part of the benefit of longer term
planning is to understand higher level priorities and keep focused on
big picture execution, rather than changing direction sprint to sprint.

Culture or misunderstood expectations
-------------------------------------

Culture is almost unfair to list as a problem that contributes to
planning but I want to list it because I work with a lot of leaders who
absolutely say and want the right things and yet their teams either
don't believe them or ignore it. Here is an example: a belief that long
term estimates must be commitments. We know the accuracy of an estimate
is related to the time frame we use (eg- estimating for a day is easier
than estimating for a year). Yet I have worked with teams that
absolutely believed that the guesses that they made in an annual
planning offsite needed to be 100% accurately delivered. When I
questioned them and the executive team about this, I found that often
the execs were reasonable in understanding these were planning
projections which needed to be vetted. In Acme's case, it was the middle
level managers who had created these estimates that most believed that
they were fixed. When faced with feedback that the estimates were
incorrect, they did everything in their power to deliver on them ---
including taking shortcuts or working in a way that didn't make them
proud --- rather than change the estimate.

Another culture factor is the presence of a culture of fear. This one is
tough to understand but can be easily seen. It looks something like
this: "I have to deliver this plan. If I don't, then something bad will
happen." No one ever can tell me \*exactly\* what the bad thing is
(someone will yell? a bad performance review? someone gets fired? all of
it?). Yet fear of this "bad thing" influences behaviors. The challenge
with a culture of fear is that it prevents teams from taking risks,
often learning and innovating. I have never seen teams in this
environment deliver better than those in cultures without it.





Anti-Patterns: Scrum Master
===========================

Teams cannot create longer term estimates
-----------------------------------------

Agile teams have many techniques to estimate. My personal favorite for
longer term planning is to use story points with a Fibonacci scale, but
I've seen teams use different techniques and still be fine. However,
there are times when any of the tried and true techniques fail to
work...because the team *cannot*reliably estimate.

Here are some reasons why this may be the case:

-   the code or the problem/domain is completely new. Without experience
    or a point of reference, any estimate is a massive guess.
-   the team members are completely new and have no common frame of
    reference.
-   there is too much technical debt or too many hidden surprises.

Remember the company that I introduced at the beginning, Acme? Their
code had serious performance and scalability problems (so serious in
fact that, painfully, they ultimately chose to rewrite everything rather
than fix it). Any estimate would be inaccurate for Acme's teams. Either
they would miss issues that they would later encounter when building new
scalable code in a debt ridden codebase or they would include such an
extreme buffer on their estimates that they were essentially useless.
Yet these teams continued to be asked for estimates (when will this be
done? can it be done sooner?) and time after time, miss all commitments.
It wasn't their fault. Estimation was nearly impossible. Leaders asking
the question over and over again didn't make the answers any more
reliable.

Excessive Tailoring
-------------------

While some deviation from the standard practices is usually not a big
deal, excessive tailoring of the defined process in terms of scope and
frequency can lead to problems such as change fatigue by the team. For
example, constantly changing the duration of the sprints or sprint
events, changing the location of daily Scrums, modifying the frequency
of the backlog refinement meetings, etc. Even though some changes may
seem very minor on the surface, unless there's a good reason to
implement the change, team members can begin to lose confidence in the
team's ability to execute due to the unnecessary distractions.

Complacent with Status Quo
--------------------------

In contrast to the first point, a Scrum Master who doesn't like change,
or avoid change at all cost, will also create problems for the team. The
key is to achieve a delicate balance of the magnitude and frequency of
process improvement ideas. Scrum encourages the Scrum Team to "inspect
and adapt", but it does not say how often or how much; it is up to the
team to decide what changes are meaningful and digestible, and will lead
to positive returns. It is the Scrum Master's job to encourage this
mindset and to be open to trial/error.

Solves Problems for Others
--------------------------

Very often, a Scrum Master is considered to be "effective" when he/she
solves problems or does work that the team should own for themselves.
This mindset is often a result of the Scrum Master having previously
served as a Project Manager, who is accustomed to taking ownership of
issues and addressing them. This behavior can be counterproductive
because it trains the team to pass off issues instead of owning them and
resolving them, which allows them to learn from the experience and
improve as a team.

Competes Against Other Teams
----------------------------

I have personally witnessed Scrum Masters who attempt to motivate the
team by citing the performance of other teams within the same program or
organization. This is an easy trap to fall into, but is potentially very
damaging to team morale. Motivating by fear or stress may reap some
gains in the short term, but will likely to cause more harm than good in
the long run. Trying to out-perform other teams is a natural inclination
by high-performing teams that like to feel the sense of "winning"; this
can be especially highlighted when an organization imposes a
distribution system for compensation increases which creates an inherent
competition amongst peers. The Scrum Master's job is to motivate the
team through a sense of accomplishment and mastery, not by fear.

Avoids Conflict
---------------

It is human nature to feel a sense of security and safety, especially in
a group setting. This explains why some Scrum Masters often avoid
conflict instead of finding ways to resolve it. This is especially true
if the Scrum Master does not have a lot of experience with conflict
resolution. If the same issues/conflicts continue to surface within the
team, it is very likely that the Scrum Master needs help to address
them.

Follows the Same Retrospective Format Every Sprint
--------------------------------------------------

After a team has been working together for several sprints and is able
to deliver successful outputs, it can reach a point of complacency (or
plateau). This condition is exhibited in many ways, and one way to
identify this is that Retrospectives become very stale or repetitive. If
the Scrum Master always follows the same format to conduct
Retrospectives, it can create a sense of repetition that stifles
innovation and new ideas. To avoid this, challenge the Scrum Master to
change the format at least every two sprints so that team can leverage
the Retrospective to continue improving.

Does Not Like to be Challenged/Questioned
-----------------------------------------

Some Scrum Masters are not used to being challenged by the team or
external team members because they see this as an attack to their domain
knowledge instead of an opportunity for improvement. This can occur as
an aftermath of excessive process tailoring that does not include
explanations on "why" certain activities are done. If this behavior is
identified, one approach to address this is to coach the Scrum Master to
provide more context when decisions related to process is made, which
will help clarify the rationale.

Assign Tasks to Team Members
----------------------------

Another common mistake that Scrum Masters make is to assign specific
tasks to team members instead of enabling them to take collective
ownership of the work. This is especially likely to occur if the Scrum
Master comes from a Project Management background where the work is
delegated from the top down using a "command and control" approach.
Since the team has the best understanding of its capabilities, they are
in the best position to know who can take on certain tasks. There may be
situations when a less experienced team member may choose a task that is
too complex for his/her skillset; if this occurs, it's the Scrum
Master's responsibility to bring this to the attention of the team and
help them assess whether there are better alternatives to this approach.





Anti-Patterns: Product Owner
============================

Backlog
-------

The backlog takes many forms. One form is that the Product Owner is too
busy to define at a high level what they want. They only define the
immediate Sprint/iteration or two Sprints/iterations worth of work. This
means that the team has no idea about the long-term vision, only
immediate goals. This does not give the team ownership of the tasks.

Teams don't understand their product backlogs
---------------------------------------------

It never fails to surprise me how many product backlogs are a list of
single-line phrases in a tool. I get it. Writing requirements is time
consuming. Long ago, people wrote very comprehensive documents to
describe every requirement, how to build the requirement, every edge
case to test and a bunch of things that they thought they may want
someday. These documents were intended to cover everything thereby
eliminating the need for conversation or negotiation. Fortunately, we
now know that these documents create a ton of waste --- either we build
things that no one wants, build things incorrectly or take too long to
get feedback from our customers.

I don't see these type of documents anymore, which is progress. But it's
not uncommon to see backlogs in a tool (let's call it JIRA) which list
"requirements" that look like this:

*Build authorization capability*

*Allow user to edit and save information*

*Fix performance issues* ...and that's it.

If this all sounds familiar, then we're going to have to first admit
this isn't a product backlog which supports planning. It's not easy to
estimate, prioritize or execute independently. In some cases, it's so
ambiguous that every team member may assume something completely
different.

Also let's be fair to our teams --- this is not engaging or interesting.
How are they going to get inspired by who they are helping and why? Do
they all have the same understanding of the customer (or user)? What
does our customer need? How will we know we're satisfying that need? Or
better yet, what business problem are we trying to address? Why? How do
we know we are done?





Anti-Patterns: Stand-up
=======================

Reporting Session
-----------------

The manager expects that everyone delivers a sort of status report. The
anti-pattern has an advanced version: the manager "runs" the stand-up,
signaling the team members when it is their turn to speak.

Talkative Chickens
------------------

By definition, the manager is a "chicken," and chickens are supposed to
listen in. Actively participating in stand-ups is reserved for team
members. (It is acceptable if managers ask a question during the
stand-up, though. Beyond that they can talk at any time to the product
owner or scrum master.)

Anti-Agile
----------

Line managers are attending stands-up to gather "performance data" on
individual team members. (Do not be surprised to find them thinking in
the story-points-per-developer "performance" category as well.)





Anti-Patterns: Sprints
======================

Product Owner
-------------

### Abset Product Owner

The Product Owner is absent most of the Sprint and is not available to
answer questions of the Development Team. (As the Sprint Backlog is
emergent and new work may be identified as necessary to achieve the
Sprint Goal, this attitude might leave the Development Team in the dark,
risking the accomplishment of the Sprint Goal.)

### Product Owner clining to tasks

The Product Owner cannot let go of Product Backlog items once they
become part of the Sprint Backlog. For example, the Product Owner
increases the scope of a requirement. Or, he or she changes acceptance
criteria once the team accepted the issue into the Sprint Backlog.
(There is a clear line: before a Product Backlog item turns into a part
of the Sprint Backlog, the Product Owner is responsible. However, once
it moves from one backlog to the other, the Development Team becomes
responsible. If changes become acute during the Sprint the team will
collaboratively decide on how to handle them.)

### Inflexible Product Owner

The Product Owner is not flexible to adjust acceptance criteria. (If the
work on a task reveals that the agreed-upon acceptance criteria are no
longer achievable or waste, the Scrum Team needs to adapt to the new
reality. Blindly following the original plan violates core Scrum
principles.)

### Delaying Product Owner

The Product Owner does not accept items from the Sprint Backlog once
those are finished. Instead, he or she waits until the end of the
Sprint. (The Product Owner should immediately check tasks that meet the
acceptance criteria. Otherwise, the Product Owner will create an
artificial queue within the Sprint, which will unnecessarily increase
the cycle-time. This habit puts also reaching the Sprint Goal at risk.)

### Misuses of Sprint Cancellation

The Product Owner cancels Sprints to impose his or her will onto the
team. (It is the prerogative of the Product Owner to cancel Sprints.
However, the Product Owner should not do this without a serious cause.
The Product Owner should also never abort a Sprint without consulting
the Development Team first. Probably, the team has an idea of how to
save the sprint. Lastly, misusing the cancellation privilege also
indicates a serious team collaboration issue.)

### No Sprint Cancellation

The Product Owner does not cancel a Sprint whose sprint goal can no
longer be achieved. (If the Product Owner identified a unifying Sprint
Goal, for example, integrating a new payment method, and the management
then abandons that payment method mid-sprint, continuing working on the
Sprint Goal would be a waste. In this case, the Product Owner should
consider canceling the sprint.)





Development Team
----------------

### No WIP Limit

There is no work in progress limit. (The purpose of the Sprint is to
deliver a potentially shippable Product Increment that provides value to
the customers and thus to the organization. This goal requires focused
work to accomplish the work deemed necessary to meet the Sprint Goal by
the end of the Sprint. The flow theory suggests that the productivity of
a team improves with a work-in-progress (WiP) limit. The WiP limit
defines the maximum number of tasks a development team can work on at
the same time. Exceeding this WiP number results in creating additional
queues that consequently reduce the overall throughput of the
Development Team. The cycle time, which is the period between starting
and finishing a ticket, measures this effect.)

### Cherry-picking

The Development Team cherry-picks work. (This effect often overlays with
the missing WiP issue. Human beings are motivated by short-term
gratifications. It just feels good to solve yet another puzzle from the
board, here: coding a new task. By comparison to this  [dopamine
fix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7E0mTJQ2KM "2-Minute Neuroscience: Reward System")
, checking how someone else solved another problem during code review is
less rewarding. Hence you often notice tickets queuing in the
code-review-column, for example. It is also a sign that the Development
Team is not yet fully self-organizing. Look also for Daily Scrum events
that support this notion, and address the issue during the Sprint
Retrospective.)

### Board out-of-date

The team does not update tickets on the Sprint board in time to reflect
the current statuses. (The Sprint board, no matter if it is a physical
or digital board, is not only vital for coordinating the Development
Team's work. It is also an integral part of the communication of the
Scrum Team with its stakeholders. A board that is not up-to-date will
impact the trust the stakeholders have in the Scrum Team. Deteriorating
trust may then cause counter-measures on the side of the stakeholders.
The (management) pendulum may swing back toward traditional methods as a
consequence. The road back to PRINCE II is paved with abandoned boards.)

### Side-gigs

The Development Team is working on issues that are not visible on the
board. (While sloppiness is excusable, siphoning off resources, and
by-passing the Product Owner---who is accountable for the return on
investment the Development Team is creating---is unacceptable. This
behavior also signals a substantial conflict within the "team." Given
this display of distrust---why didn't the engineers address this
seemingly important issue during the Sprint Planning or before---the
Development Team is probably rather a group anyway.)

### Gold-plating

The Development Team increases the scope of the Sprint by adding
unnecessary work to Product Backlog items of the Sprint Backlog. (This
effect is often referred to as scope-stretching or gold-plating. The
Development team ignores the original scope agreement with the Product
Owner. For whatever reason, the team enlarges the task without prior
consulting of the Product Owner. This ignorance may result in a
questionable allocation of resources. However, there is a simple
solution: the developers and the Product Owner need to talk more often
with each other, creating a shared understanding from product vision
down to the individual Product Backlog item, thus improving the trust
level. If the Product Owner is not yet co-located with the Development
Team, now would be the right moment to reconsider.)

Scrum Master
------------

### Flow Disruption

The Scrum Master allows stakeholders to disrupt the flow of the Scrum
Team during the Sprint. There are several possibilities for how
stakeholders can interrupt the flow of the team during a sprint. Any of
the examples will impede the team's productivity and might endanger the
Sprint goal. The Scrum Master must prevent them from manifesting
themselves: 

-   The Scrum Master has a laissez-faire policy as far as access to the
    Development team is concerned. Particularly, he or she is not
    educating stakeholders on the negative impact of disruptions and how
    those may endanger the accomplishment of the Sprint goal.
-   The Scrum Master does not oppose line managers taking team members
    off the team assigning other tasks.
-   Lastly, the Scrum Master allows that either stakeholders or managers
    turn the Daily Scrum into a reporting session. This behavior will
    impede the Development Team's productivity by undermining its
    self-organization, reintroducing command & control through the
    backdoor.)

### Lack of Support

The Scrum Master does not support team members that need help with a
task. Often, development teams create tasks an engineer can finish
within a day. However, if someone struggles with such a job for more
than two days without voicing that he or she needs support, the Scrum
Master should address the issue and offer his or her support. By the
way, this is also the reason for marking tasks on a physical Sprint
board with red dots each day if tasks do not move to the next column.
(In other words: we are tracking the work item age.)

### Micro-manangement

The Scrum Master does not prevent the Product Owner---or anyone
else---from assigning tasks to engineers. (The Development Team
organizes itself without external intervention. And the Scrum Master is
the shield of the team in that respect.)

### No Retro

There is no Retrospective as the team believes there is nothing to
improve. (There is no such thing as an agile Nirvana where everything is
just perfect. As people say: becoming agile is a journey, not a
destination, and there is always something to improve.) 

Scrum Teams
-----------

### The Maverick & the Sprint Backlog

Someone adds an item to the Sprint Backlog without consulting the
Development Team first. (The control of the Sprint Backlog by the
Development Team---in the sense of workload---is at the core of enabling
the team to make a forecast. The scope is hence per se untouchable
during the Sprint. Changes in the composition of Sprint Backlog are
possible, for example, when a critical bug pops up after a Sprint's
start. However, adding such an issue to the Sprint Backlog requires
approval by the Development Team and probably a level of compensation.
Another task of a similar size might need to go back to the Product
Backlog. All these exceptions have in common that the Development Team
has the final say collectively. No single teammate of the Scrum team can
add or remove an item to or from the Sprint Backlog single-handedly.)

### Hardening Sprint

The Scrum Team decides to have a hardening or clean-up sprint. (That is
a simple one: there is no such thing as a hardening sprint in Scrum. The
goal of the Sprint is the delivery of a valuable potentially shippable
Product Increment. For that purpose, the Development Team creates a
definition of "Done" to ensure that everyone understands the required
quality level for a product Increment to be "shippable" to customers.
Declaring buggy tasks "done" thus violates this core Scrum principle of
collaboration. Hardening Sprints are commonly a sign of a low grade of
adoption of agile principles by the team or the organization. This is
probably because the team is not yet cross-functional. Or quality
assurance is still handled by a functional, non-agile silo with the
product delivery organization. Alternatively, the Development Team might
have felt pressured to deliver to meet an (arbitrary) deadline, and they
decided to cut corners by reducing quality. No matter the reason, in
such a situation, there is plenty of work for the Scrum Master to
accomplish.) 

### Delivering Y instead of X

The Product Owner believes in getting X. The Development Team is working
on Y. (This is not merely a result of an inferior Product Backlog
refinement. This anti-pattern indicates that the Scrum Team failed to
create a shared understanding. There are plenty of reasons for this to
happen, just to list a few:

-   The Product Owner and the Development Team members are not talking
    enough during the Sprint. (The Product Owner is too busy to answer
    questions from the team or attend the Daily Scrum. Or, the team is
    not co-located, etc.)
-   No Development Team member has ever participated in user tests or
    customer interviews. There is a lack of understanding of the users'
    problems among engineers. (This is the reason why engineers should
    also interview users regularly.)
-   The Product Owner presented a too granular user story, and no one
    from the Development Team cared enough to have a thorough look. The
    user story seemed ready.
-   Probably, the user story was missing acceptance criteria altogether,
    or existing acceptance criteria missed the problem. No matter the
    reason, the Scrum Team should address the issue during the next
    retrospective.)

### No Sense of Urgency

There is no potentially shippable Product Increment at the end of the
Sprint. There was no reason to cancel the Sprint either. It was just an
ordinary Sprint. (This is a sign that the Scrum Team lacks the sense of
urgency to deliver at the end of the Sprint. If it is acceptable to fail
on delivering value at the end of the Sprint, the whole idea behind
Scrum is questioned. Remember, a Scrum Team trades a forecast for
inclusion in decision-making, autonomy, and self-organization. Creating
a low-grade time-boxed Kanban and calling it "Scrum" will not honor this
deal. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Scrum Team to make
each Sprint's outcome releasable even if the release will not
materialize.)

### New kid on the block

The Scrum Team welcomed a new team member during the Sprint. They also
forgot to address the issue during Sprint Planning thus ending up
overextended. (While it is acceptable to welcome new teammates during a
Sprint, the team needs to account for the resulting onboarding effort
during the Sprint Planning and adjust its capacity. The new team member
should not be a surprise. However, if the newbie turns out to be a
surprise it is rather an organizational anti-pattern.)

### Variable Sprint Length

The Scrum Team extends the Sprint length by a few days to meet the
Sprint Goal. (This is just another way of cooking the agile books to
match a goal or a metric. This is not agile; it is just inconsequential.
Stop lying to yourself, and address the underlying issues why the team
outcome does not meet the Sprint Goal. 

**Note**: I would not consider a deviating Sprint length during the
holiday season at the end of the year to be an anti-pattern.)

![](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/inline-images/Sprint-Anti-Patterns-Hardening-Sprint-Age-of-Product-com.jpg.jpg)





IT Management
=============

All hands to pump w/o Scrum
---------------------------

The management temporarily abandons Scrum in a critical situation. (This
is a classic manifestation of disbelief in agile practices, fed by
command & control thinking. Most likely, canceling Sprints and gathering
the Scrum Teams would also solve the issue at hand.) 

Reassigning team members
------------------------

The management regularly assigns team members of one Scrum Team to
another team. (Scrum can only live up to its potential if the Scrum Team
members can build trust among each other. The longevity of teams is
hence essential. Moving people between teams, on the contrary, reflects
a project-minded idea of management, rooted in utilization optimization
at the team member level of the industrial paradigm. It also ignores the
preferred team-building practice that Scrum Teams should select
themselves. All members need to be voluntarily on a team. Scrum does
rarely work if team members are pressed into service.

**Note**: It is not an anti-pattern, though, if the Scrum Teams decide
to exchange teammates temporarily. It is an established practice that
specialists spread knowledge this way or mentor other colleagues.) 

Special Forces
--------------

A manager assigns specific tasks directly to engineers, thus bypassing
the Product Owner and ignoring the Development Team's prerogative to
self-organize. Alternatively, the manager removes an engineer from a
team to work on such a task. (This behavior does not only violate core
Scrum principles. It also indicates that the manager cannot let go of
command and control practices. He or she continues to micromanage
subordinates, although a Scrum Team could accomplish the task in a
self-organized manner. This behavior demonstrates a level of ignorance
that may require support for the Scrum Master from a higher management
level to deal with.)





Stakeholders
============

Disrupting the flow
-------------------

The stakeholders disrupt the flow of the Scrum Team. (See above, Scrum
Master section.)

Making Sprint Logher to Accommodate to Scope
--------------------------------------------

A team has planned 10 user stories for a two weeks sprint. On the last
day, 9 of 10 are done, and the team is pretty certain the remaining user
story should take about 2 days to complete. The team insists on
extending the sprint. They eventually finish the story in 4 days, which
results in the actual sprint duration of 14 days. The same keeps
happening in the following sprints too.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2040/1*_-gw1ixlZ0yf35O54Hm4zw.jpeg)

Schedule slippages are quite a usual thing in software development. To a
point that they may be considered inherent and unavoidable. When a
slippage occurs, people have the intuitive desire to extend the sprint
in order to deliver the full planned scope.

> A team --- or team's management, or the product owner --- think that
> completing full scope is what defines the end of an iteration.

This mistake has its roots in traditional management that revolves
around scope commitments as the primary tool for execution control. As
soon as the scope for a project is defined and estimated, the commitment
to delivering the scope is formed. The key focus now is fulfilling the
commitment, i.e. delivering the scope before the estimated deadline, and
if it's not possible then the easiest way to fix this is to adjust the
schedule. I'm oversimplifying here, of course, as there are still
options for de-scoping and playing with the team size. Nonetheless, in
this paradigm completing full scope is considered the baseline to adjust
from. And that's exactly what the concept of sprint (aka iteration or
timebox) tries to turn upside down. See [Waterfall vs Agile - Estimation](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/IT/Waterfall+vs+Agile+-+Estimation).

The adverse effects of changing iteration length at will are quite
dramatic.

First, the whole process turns into chaos and sways the team off pace.
The activities that are supposed to be regular and automatic now require
case-by-case scheduling. This creates unnecessary procedural overhead.
The team quickly gets tired of this and slips into ad-hoc process and
ad-hoc in reality means no process at all.

Second, any kind of planning based on historical data becomes
over-complicated and unreliable. One of the most popular metrics to
generate historical data in Agile teams is velocity. Just like in
physics it is a measure of distance covered in a unit of time, in
software development it is the amount of work completed in a unit of
time (the definition of 'amount of work' may vary from team to team).
Now imagine your unit of time is variable. The very definition of
velocity doesn't make sense any more.

Everything\'s a Bug Philosophy
------------------------------

The stakeholders and manager tries to speed up delivery of certain
features by relabeling tasks as 'serious bugs.' (A special case is an
"express lane" for bug fixes and other urgent issues. Every manager will
try and make his or her tasks eligible for that express lane.)

Pitching Developers
-------------------

The stakeholders and manager tries to sneak in small tasks by pitching
them directly to developers, this ignoring the product owner as well as
basic scrum principles.

Status Updates
--------------

Stand-ups is not a status update for the Product Owner, Scrum Master or
Management

Meeting Duration
----------------

Stand-ups goes more than 15 minutes.  People start to tune out

Cloning Incomplete Work Items Instead of Carrying Them Over
-----------------------------------------------------------

*A team has completed a sprint but "User Story X" is still not finished.
The team wants to visualize the progress they've made on this story. On
their task board they have a card for it. They rename it to "User Story
X Part 1" and move it to Done. They also create a card named "User Story
X Part 2" and put it in the next sprint. They don't manage to finish the
story in the next sprint either. So they create "User Story X Part 3"
and now move "Part 2" to Done. This exercise repeats itself a few more
times.*

*![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2040/1*-gdzLa7T3-l5Cez1gkNwPQ.jpeg)

This one I've seen quite a lot, usually with digital task trackers ---
probably because the operation of copying is so cheap there. Whenever a
team is not able to complete a story, they clone it to the next
iteration. The original story becomes "part N" and gets closed and the
clone is now "part N+1".

There's a number of possible reasons why this happens. The most obvious
is probably the team's desire to reward themselves for performing work,
otherwise they are left with the feeling of unfairness. Another typical
reason is cargo-culting the golden rule of fitting a user story in a
single sprint. I've seen both in my career. Instead of focusing on the
root cause, a team simply makes up an artificial completed item.

Such way of tracking work has numerous issues.

First of all, it never actually shows real progress. Whether a user
story is done or not can only be evaluated with the ultimate objective
criterion --- is it live or not. In Scrum you can strengthen (or weaken)
this criterion by the means of Definition of Done. This aligns with one
of the Agile principles: working software is the primary measure of
progress. By cutting a user story into parts like shown in the example
you are doing something as nonsensical as saying, "I've mowed half of
the lawn, although I still don't know how big it is". How do you know
then it's a half and not a quarter?

Second, such tracking removes the incentive of slicing user stories
vertically into smaller pieces. There's no pressure to have a story that
you can truly complete in one sprint because you have a 100% guarantee
to have a completed item at the end of each and every sprint.

Then, if you use a digital tool for tracking, it messes up with your
data. There's no easy way to calculate true lead time or true velocity
when you keep adding entities for the same piece of work. The data on
the items doesn't show true numbers and if you want true numbers, you
need to aggregate them from multiple different sources.

And lastly, continuously cloning items simply wastes your time on
unnecessary activities. I've seen teams wasting the entire sprint review
on just creating new clones in for the next sprint.



Anti-Patterns: Sprint Review
============================

Scrum à la stage-gate
---------------------

The sprint/iteration review is a kind of stage-gate approval process
where managers sign off features. (This anti-pattern is typical for
organizations that use an agile-waterfall hybrid. Otherwise, it is the
prerogative or the product owner to decide what to ship when.)



No Manager in the Trenches
--------------------------

Managers do not attend the sprint/iteration review. (There are several
reasons why managers do not attend the sprint/iteration review: they do
not see any value in the ceremony. It is conflicting with another
important meeting. They do not understand the importance of the
sprint/iteration review event. None of the sponsors is participating in
the sprint/iteration review, for example, from the C-level. To my
experience, you need to "sell" the ceremony within the organization to
successfully transition to an agile organization.

Starting Over Again
-------------------

There is no continuity in the attendance of managers. (Longevity is not
just a team issue, but also applies to stakeholders. If they change too
often, for example, because of a rotation scheme, how can they provide
in-depth feedback? If this pattern appears the team needs to improve how
managers understand the sprint/iteration review.)

Passive Managers
----------------

The managers are passive and unengaged. (That is simple to fix. Let the
managers drive the sprint/iteration review and put them at the helm. Or
organize the sprint/iteration review as a science fair with several
booths.)




Anti-Patterns: Retrospective
============================

Line Managers are Present
-------------------------

Line managers participate in retrospectives. (This is the worst
anti-pattern I can think off. It turns the retrospective into an unsafe
place. And who would expect that an unsafe place triggers an open
discussion among the team members? Any line manager who insists on such
a proceeding signals his or her lack of understanding of basic agile
practices. Note: If you are small product delivery team at a start-up
and your part-time scrum master (or product owner) also serves in a
management function, retrospectives might be challenging. In this case,
consider hiring an external scrum master to facilitate meaningful
retrospectives.)

Let us see your Minutes
-----------------------

Someone from the organization---outside the team---requires access to
the retrospective minutes. (This is almost as bad as line managers who
want to participate in a retrospective. Of course, the access need be
denied as retrospectives are a safe place.)

No Suitable Venue
-----------------

There is no adequate place available to run the retrospective. (The
least appropriate place to have a retrospective is a meeting room with a
rectangular table surrounded by chairs. And yet it is the most common
venue to have a retrospective. Becoming agile requires space. If this
space is not available, you should become creative and go somewhere
else. If the weather is fine, grab your Post-its and go outside. Or rent
a suitable space somewhere else. If that is not working, for example,
due to budget issues, remove at least the table so you can sit/stand in
a circle. Just be creative. Read More: Agile Workspace: The Undervalued
Success Factor.)
