Information Technology : SAFe Program Level 
===========================================




The Program Level contains the roles and activities needed to
continuously deliver solutions via an Agile Release Train (ART).
The program level is where development teams, stakeholders, and other
resources are devoted to some important, ongoing system
development mission. The ART metaphor describes the program level teams,
roles, and activities that incrementally deliver a continuous flow of
value. ARTs are virtual organizations formed to span functional
boundaries, eliminate unnecessary handoffs and steps, and accelerate
value delivery by implementing SAFe Lean-Agile principles and practices.
Although it is called the program level, ARTs are long-lived and,
therefore, have a more persistent self-organization, structure, and
mission than traditional programs which usually have definitive start
and end dates, as well as temporarily assigned resources. The ARTs
operating at the Program Level are ultimately responsible for creating
and releasing value in flow at the frequency needed by the enterprise to
meet market and customer demand. The mindsets and practices in this
level contribute to the enterprise competency of DevOps and Release on
Demand that makes this flow of value possible.\

-   In Program level, Value of SAFe is delivered by long-lived Agile
    Release Trains (ART). Iteration is for team and train is for the
    program.
-   Agile Release Trains (ART) is the primary vehicle for value delivery
    at the program level. It delivers a value stream to the
    organization.
-   The Program Increments (PIs) duration is of 8 to 12 weeks.
-   ART is of 5 - 12 Agile Teams (\~50 -- 125+ people) which includes
    all the roles and infrastructure needed to deliver fully tested,
    working, system-level software.
-   Each PI is a multiple-Iteration time box. During which a
    significant, valuable increment of the system is developed and
    delivered.
-   In each PI a \"demo\" and \"Inspect and adapt\" sessions will
    happen, and Planning begins for the next PSI.
-   At the Program level, SAFe emphasis on the principle of alignment.
    This is because multiple agile team efforts are integrated to create
    customer value.
-   SAFe artifact hierarchy is  **Epics-\>features-\>user stories**.
-   At a Program level, Product Manager/Program Manager has content
    authority. He defines and prioritizes the program backlog.
-   Program backlog is a prioritized list of features.
-   At the program level, features can be originated, or they can derive
    from epics defined at the portfolio level.
-   Features decompose to user stories and flow into team-level
    backlogs.
-   Product Manager or the Release Train Engineer role could be handled
    by the Program Manager/Senior Project Manager
-   System Architect role at the program level is to collaborate day to
    day work with the teams. It ensures that non-functional requirements
    are met. Also, they work with the enterprise architect at the
    portfolio level to make sure there is sufficient architectural
    runway to support upcoming user and business needs.
-   Interface design, user experience guidelines and design elements for
    the teams are provided by UX Designers.
-   Chief-Scrum Master role is played by \'Release Train Engineer\'.
-   Various team (from marketing, development, quality, operations, and
    deployment) forms \'Release Management Team\'. They will approve
    routine releases of quality solutions to customers.
-   Deployment of software into customer environments and successful
    delivery is taken care of by DevOps team.
