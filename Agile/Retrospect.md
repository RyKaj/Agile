Agile : Retrospect 
==================


The sprint retrospective is usually the last thing done in a sprint.
Many teams will do it immediately after the sprint review. The entire
team, including both the ScrumMaster and the product owner should
participate. You can schedule a scrum retrospective for up to an hour,
which is usually quite sufficient. However, occasionally a hot topic
will arise or a team conflict will escalate and the retrospective could
take significantly longer.

Although there are manyÂ ways to conduct an agile sprint retrospective,
our recommendation is to conduct it as a start-stop-continue meeting.
This is perhaps the simplest, but often the most effective way to
conduct a retrospective. Using this approach each team member is asked
to identify specific things that the team should:

-   What worked well for us?
-   What did not work well for us?
-   What actions can we take to improve our process going forward?

The Agile retrospective can be thought of as a \"lessons learned\"
meeting. The team reflects on how everything went and then decides what
changes they want to make in the next iteration. The retrospective is
team-driven, and team members should decide together how the meetings
will be run and how decisions will be made about improvements.

An atmosphere of honesty and trust is needed in order for every member
to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts. Norman Kerth\'s work at the
turn of the millennium was highly important to the development of Agile
retrospectives and retrospectives in general. Kerth\'s prime directive
states, \"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly
believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew
at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and
the situation at hand.\"

Because Agile stresses the importance of [continuous improvement](https://searcherp.techtarget.com/definition/kaizen-or-continuous-improvement),
having a regular Agile retrospective is one of the most important of
Agile development practices. The Ninth Agile principle outlined in the
[Agile manifesto](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/Agile-Manifesto)
states, \"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\" A
framework, such as the one below, can be used to provide structure and
keep discussion during the retrospective focused.

1.  Set the stage - get the team ready to engage in the retrospective,
    perhaps with a warm-up activity such as Plus, Minus, Interesting (
    [PMI](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/PMI-plus-minus-interesting-retrospective))
    (5 minutes)
2.  Gather data - create a shared picture of what happened during the
    retrospective (10 minutes)
3.  Generate insights - discuss what was successful and identify any
    roadblocks to success (10 minutes)
4.  Decide what to do - identify highest priority items to work on and
    put measurable goals on those items so they can be completed (15
    minutes)
5.  Close the retrospective - reflect on the retrospective and how to
    improve it, and to appreciate accomplishments of the team and
    individual interactions (5 minutes)
