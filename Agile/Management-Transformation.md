Manager
-------

[As a manager, you are no longer able to tell the members of your team (often called a squad) what to do and how to do it. You were also told that the product manager is responsible for prioritizing activities and that improving operational processes falls under the oversight of the scrum master.]

Transitioning to the Role of Agile Manager

Former Role - Traditional Manager

New Role - Agile Manager

A generalist manager responsible for the following activities:

-   Managing the members of their team - Business knowledge and/or
    technical expertise
-   Process or Project Management

A manager specialized in one (1) of the following areas of activity:

-   People / talent management
-   Product or business line management
-   Project or process management


**With unchanging responsibilities...**

-   Communicating the business's vision and keeping everything aligned
    with the company's values
-   Removing obstacles that impair the team
-   Defining the team's business objectives

**With changing responsibilities that need to be delegated to the team...**

-   Choosing tools and methods
-   Hiring, integration (and firing)
-   Performance reviews (individual and team)
-   Skills development
-   Budget management


**And with new responsibilities to integrate...**

-   Implementing and supporting self-organization
-   Coaching and mentoring in your new area of expertise
-   Supporting the team's continual development
-   Creating a work environment that is conducive to motivation and
    performance
-   Being a facilitator (not a supervisor)

Different Roles of a Manager in a Traditional Business
------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Managing the members of their team**. One of the main
    responsibilities of a manager consists of selecting, hiring,
    evaluating, promoting, supporting and developing the members of
    their team.
2.  **Business knowledge and/or technical expertise**. Many managers are
    contributors who, over the course of their career, have developed
    technical expertise or important business knowledge for the
    organization. Having demonstrated their expertise and contribution
    to the organization, they spend a significant amount of time using
    their skills (technical or business) to resolve problems encountered
    by their team.
3.  **Process or project management**. In addition to their other
    responsibilities, managers generally spend a significant amount of
    time managing their team members' projects. In a traditional
    context, they are often responsible for determining which team
    member is assigned to which activity and are therefore responsible
    for monitoring the progress of the various aspects of the project.
    Depending on their expertise, they might also design the business
    processes used by their team members.

New Roles of a Manager in an Agile Business
-------------------------------------------

While traditional managers contribute as generalists, in an agile
environment, managers must choose an area of specialization between
people management, product management, or process/project management.
Some of the manager's former responsibilities are transferred to the
self-organized team (see below), and the agile manager becomes a coach
for the members of their self-organized team. Therefore, the agile
manager helps their squad to acquire and develop new skills

### People / Talent Management

In an agile organization, the people manager does not directly supervise
the members of their self-organized team, as they are not involved in
their team's daily work.

Consequently, the responsibilities for hiring, integrating, reviewing
and developing the members of a self-organized team are often
transferred to the team itself. The new position of people manager is to
support the team members through the integration of their new
responsibilities, and through the development of the skills they need to
succeed.

The challenge many traditional managers face when transitioning to this
role is detaching themselves from their involvement in the team's daily
activities and instead focusing on the development of skills for each of
the individual team members and of the squad as a whole.

### Product or Business Line Management 

In an agile organization, technical expertise (architecture,
technological orientation, etc.) is generally repatriated to members of
the self-organized team. This expertise is distributed to the team
members or assigned to a specialist.

In parallel, the organization's business-related expertise---products or
services (financial management, business rules, product portfolio
management, etc.)---is centralized under the position of  [product
owner](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/product-owner),
who ensures the evolution of the product (or service).

The traditional manager who opts for a product-based (or service-based)
specialization must develop market knowledge, strategic skills, and
product lifecycle knowledge in order to optimize the use of the
resources made available to them.

The manager therefore sets the priorities for the self-organized team.
As product owners become responsible for profitability management, they
need to develop business unit management skills and develop their
understanding of the needs of their market.

One of the greatest difficulties faced by traditional managers in this
new position is relinquishing the need to directly control the people
who work for them. They must evolve from a micromanagement role to the
daily management of a business line.

### Project or Process Management

Organizational agility leads to an increase in project mode operations.
Consequently, the need for project management expertise increases. This
need for expertise is an opportunity for traditional managers.

Thus, in an agile environment, one of the roles which the traditional
manager can take on is that of project (or process) manager, or  [scrum
master](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum-master/).

This role revolves around the planning and organization of tasks that
must be carried out by the self-organized team, and around the support
and development of a healthy team dynamic. The project manager/scrum
master becomes an agile project management process expert. They support
the self-organized team by providing a framework that enables them to
attain their goals.

In sum, the role of traditional manager---the person who leads a team
(hiring, integrating, performance reviews, skills development, career
development, salary evaluation, etc.), who is a "job" expert (technical
or business domain knowledge), and who manages projects (assigning tasks
and monitoring the progress of employees)---evolves to one of the areas
of people, product, or project specialization in an agile organization.

The transition to a specialization in agile project management can bring
some challenges for traditional managers. They have to evolve from a "
[command-and-control](http://stephenjgill.typepad.com/performance_improvement_b/2010/05/commandandcontrol-leadership-vs-peoplecentered-leadership.html)"
type management mode to a role of influencer or " [servant
leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership)"
who is there to help the self-organized team.

Responsibilities that Do not Change
-----------------------------------

Assuming the role of traditional generalist manager disappears with the
implementation of self-organizing teams, many responsibilities do
change. However, regardless of the position of manager (people, product,
or project), some responsibilities remain unchanged.

-   **Communicating the business's vision and keeping everything aligned
    with the company's values.** In their new role, the agile manager
    continues to ensure that the self-organized team's work aligns with
    the vision and values of the company. The other managers working
    alongside the agile manager ensure that the team continues to
    function within these parameters.
-   **Removing obstacles that impair the team.** As agile managers are
    there to support self-organizing teams, they still bear the
    responsibility of removing obstacles that may prevent the team from
    completing their goals.
-   **Defining the team's business objectives.** We have already
    established that the difference between a self-organizing team and a
    self-managed team is that an external manager defines the objectives
    of the latter. In this sense, managers supporting self-organized
    teams must continue to define the people objectives (skills
    development), product objectives (content, schedules and budget),
    and the (agile) process objectives.

Responsibilities Must or Should Specifically Be Transferred to the Self-Organizing Team
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Depending on how mature the team is, the following areas of
responsibility may be entirely transferred to the self-organizing team.
A game of  [delegation
poker](https://management30.com/product/delegation-poker/) may
help determine the appropriate level of delegation for each area of
responsibility.

-   **Choosing tools and methods.** Choosing tools and methods is often
    one of the first elements transferred to the self-organizing team.
    As long as objectives are clearly defined, the team is left to
    establish the best methods of achieving their objectives and
    providing the tools necessary to do so.
-   **Hiring, integration (and firing).** Many of the activities linked
    to people management can be transferred to the self-organized team.
    With training and the necessary support, team members are usually
    able to take over the tasks linked to the formation of their team.
-   **Performance reviews (individual and team).** Given that agile
    managers are no longer involved in their team's daily activities,
    individual performance reviews can now become the team's
    responsibility. By implementing agile performance review methods,
    the team can develop the mechanisms needed to improve its
    performance.
-   **Skills development.** Like performance management, skills
    development is transferred to the team members. They are in the best
    position to determine the skills that are lacking within the team
    and those that need to be improved to reach greater levels of
    performance and efficiency.
-   **Budget management.** In a self-organized team with a pre-defined
    sandbox, management of the operating budget can be delegated to the
    team. However, setting the operating budget is normally the
    responsibility of the product owner.

New Skills for Agile Manager
----------------------------

Within the context of organizational agility, people managers, product
managers, and project managers who support self-organizing teams take
charge of or contribute to these key skills:

-   **Implementing and supporting self-organization.** Very few
    employees have experienced being part of a self-organized team in a
    professional context. Consequently, acquiring the necessary skills
    to support the team in the effective implementation of
    self-organization is a specific skill. In this sense, agile managers
    have the opportunity to develop an expertise that is in demand in
    organizations taking the plunge towards agility in all their
    operations.
-   **Coaching and mentoring in their area of expertise
    (specialization).** Managers of self-organizing teams must develop
    coaching skills to evolve from manager-expert to manager-coach (or 
    [servant
    leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership)).
    It is unrealistic to think that the members of a self-organizing
    team have, from the moment the team is formed, the knowledge and
    skills necessary to be autonomous and effective. Consequently,
    traditional managers that have developed certain skills throughout
    the course of their careers (people management, product management,
    or project management) become coaches and mentors for the
    self-organizing team. They transmit their knowledge and share their
    expertise to help squads become autonomous and efficient.
-   **Supporting the team's continual development.** Yes, project
    managers/scrum masters directly support teams through their
    continued improvement, yet, agile managers can also have a positive
    impact on self-organizing teams. Beyond iteration retrospectives,
    agile managers contribute to the company's improved operations by
    supporting the integration of continuous improvement in all areas of
    activity.
-   **Creating a work environment that is conducive to motivation and
    performance.** Work environments significantly influence the
    performance of team members. Agile managers therefore must create an
    agile culture that fosters motivation and performance within their
    self-organized team.
-   **Being a facilitator (not a supervisor).** Making suggestions about
    how to overcome obstacles without imposing decisions. Supporting the
    squad when it faces obstacles and needs help.

New Skills Agile Manager Needs to Incorporate


Agile Manager do this

Not this

Are there to help their team and promote collaboration

Manager and control their team

Listen and use powerful questions

Tell their team what to do and/pr how to do it

Act as a coach and mentor

Act as an expert

Control their team and treat its members as (Incompetent, dependent)
\"children\"

See their roles as a complement to the role of the team members

See their roles as more important than the role of the team members

Why Care about Agile
--------------------

### Optimizing for flow Rather than resource utilization

This change is counterintuitive for most of us. Work is no longer
assigned, it is prepared and made available to be pulled by individuals
or teams based on their capacity and competence. This comes across as a
radical shift in mindset that middle management needs to live, and upper
management needs to understand. There is no longer direct control over
who does what, or if they're doing anything at all.  Are you ready to
trust that people will actually  *choose *to do useful work?

### Limiting work in progress

To achieve flow, we need to do less stuff. Limiting work in progress has
moderate effect if nothing changes upstream. You need to limit the
number of initiatives or projects as well. This means you need a
different approach to portfolio management. Management must understand
why, and help share this understanding with all stakeholders.

### Embracing uncertainty

An agile team isn't stoked about estimates, deadlines or detailed
roadmaps. They still plan and analyze, but prefer to do small scale
tests and experiments to prove or disprove a theory. If unexpected
things happen during implementation, we see this as a valuable learning
experience instead of a threat. Adjusting course based on things we
learn during our journey, will help us build a better product.

The trade off is that at the beginning we know very little. Upfront
information about exact cost or delivery date is not available. This has
consequences above the team level. As a manager, it is difficult to see
uncertainty as a good thing.  However, every decision made and date
promised, means less room to navigate in the future. To be agile means
to commit at the latest possible moment.

>     Every decision made and date promised, means less room to navigate in the future.

### Frequent delivery

Instead of accepting large bodies of work with a fixed delivery date,
agile teams prefer to deliver small, frequent changes. «Save early, save
often.» If you screw up (and you will), going back isn't too hard (or
humiliating).

That big change you requested will be delivered in increments. The team
roll their eyes at the detailed specification you spent days writing,
but insist that you are available for questions and discussions
throughout. The customer may get incomplete features that provide some
value, but not all the functionality she requested. We mark some
features as  *Beta*, others are only available to select customers until
they have been battle tested.

This requires good relations and good information flow between you and
your customers. To deliver incomplete stuff enables an opportunity for
feedback, and subsequently better products. Both customers and
management needs help understanding this.

Permanent teams
---------------

Agile developers prefer to work in permanent (or at least semi
permanent) teams, and build technical and domain understanding over
time. The teams are often not just technical, but rather focused around
a product or service. The team include many if not all required roles.
This is difficult in a project organization that fund and staff every
effort individually. The organization should instead fund the permanent
capability to build products.

>     Instead of funding projects, you should fund the permanent capability to build products.

We've established that the model for funding and budgeting needs to
change. Needless to say, the team can't carry out this change alone, so
again management needs to get involved.

This shift also leads to an interesting effect during prioritization and
triage. The discussions are no longer about funding and cost, but about
value and cost of delay.  How long are we willing to let this initiative
block our development pipeline? What is the consequence of delaying our
other options during this time, as opposed to delaying this option? Can
we do the most important part of this now, and the rest later (if we
still want to)?

Transparency
------------

Traditional companies are usually a bunch of silos with different goals
and objectives. Some even do internal invoicing (don't get me started).
Information is often seen as a valuable commodity used for politics and
rarely openly available.

An agile team value transparency and sharing above all. When everyone
involved share the same view of the world, we spend less time on
misunderstandings and wasted efforts. The transparent, inquisitive
nature and brutal honesty of a mature agile team can be uncomfortable
for managers. Suddenly the reply is  *«Why»* or even  *«No»* instead of 
*«Yes, sir».* The project status is  *«We are drowning in technical debt
and our speed is approaching zero»* instead of  *«Green»*. The brutal
reality that middle management used to cover up, is suddenly available
to everyone including the CEO.

Key Takeaways
=============

-   There are things that technology managers need to start doing as
    agile leaders like creating space for co-location and letting teams
    self-organize. They need to let teams think for themselves.
-   Managers need to adopt their style to the maturity of the agile
    team. Asking the right questions is important.
-   Company policies and performance measures for managers can cause
    behaviors that conflict with agile. Managers also need to let teams
    think for themselves. Managers need to create an ecosystem where
    teams can thrive.
-   There are some dates that need to be met and managers should support
    teams to meet those dates by adjusting scope or team size.
-   The agile leader mindset is critical. Managers need to focus on
    changing the organization to create an environment so that teams can
    thrive and become productive.
-   Big bang agile transformation approaches are more difficult than a
    slower, staged, team by team transition. Rolling out two or three
    teams per quarter helps build success and momentum.
-   Scrum provides a mirror of the organization and all the current
    problems become visible.
-   It can take six months to ramp-up a new team and get them to steady
    state.
-   Individual performance goals need to be revised in agile to foster
    more of a team focus; incentives need to be aligned with helping
    team mates vs. individual performance and heroics.
-   Training for technology managers is critical if they are to succeed
    as agile leaders. Leaders need to understand the "why" behind agile
    ways of working. Agile Coaches should push for immersion training
    for leaders.
-   Agile teams need to have a strong, transparent relationship with the
    business to create trust.
