Agile : Themes, Initiatives, Epics, Feature, and Stories

Theme
=====

Are large focus areas that span the organization.  Is an organization
goal that drive the creation of epics and initiatives.

A collection of stories by category. A basket or bucket of stories. By
its nature, an epic can also be a theme in itself.

However, interestingly, one group thought that themes should refer to
business goals. My view is that everything should have a goal (otherwise
why are you doing it?!)





Epic
====

An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of
smaller
[stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories),
or sometimes called "Issues" in Jira. Epics often encompass multiple
teams, on multiple projects, and can even be tracked on multiple boards.
Epics are almost always delivered over a set of sprints. As a team
learns more about an epic through development and customer feedback,
user stories will be added and removed as necessary. That's the key with
agile epics: Scope is flexible, based on customer feedback and team
cadence.

An epic is a big story. A requirement that is just too big to deliver in
a single sprint. Epics need to be broken into smaller deliverables
(stories). This helps them support [the agile
principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
(e.g. delivering working software frequently, early continuous delivery,
regular reflection).





Features
========

A distinguishing characteristic or capability of a software application
or library (e.g., performance, portability, or functionality).





User Story
==========

A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It's an
end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user's perspective.

Use Story often follow the **SMART** acronym: [specific,measurable,
achievable, relevant,time-boxed (although what the letters stand for
seems to be hotly debated).]{style="color: rgb(255,0,0);"}

The purpose of a user story is articulate how a piece of work will
deliver a particular value back to the customer. Note that \"customers\"
don\'t have to be external end users in the traditional sense, they can
also be internal customers or colleagues within your organization who
depend on your team.

User stories are a few sentences in simple language that outline the
desired outcome. They don\'t go into detail. Requirements are added
later, once agreed upon by the team.

Stories fit neatly into agile frameworks like scrum and kanban. In
scrum, user stories are added to sprints and "burned down" over the
duration of the sprint. Kanban teams pull user stories into their
backlog and run them through their workflow. It's this work on user
stories that help scrum teams get better at
[estimation](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation)
and sprint planning, leading to more accurate forecasting and greater
agility. Thanks to stories, kanban teams learn how to manage
work-in-progress (WIP) and can further refine their workflows.

User stories are also the building blocks of larger agile frameworks
like epics and initiatives. Epics are large work items broken down into
a set of stories, and multiple epics comprise an initiative. These
larger structures ensure that the day to day work of the development
team (on stores) contributes to the organizational goals built into
epics and initiatives.

A story is an individual feature or requirement that the client (and
business) wants. It is something that is deliverable (i.e. production
ready) within a single sprint. A story should use the INVEST acronym





Task
====

> **Task are not created by the Scrum Master or Product Owner. This is
> under the discretion of the development team or developer to be more
> self-organized.**

Decide which specific steps need to be completed and who is responsible
for each of them.

The elements of a story. Stepping stones to take the story to 'Done'.

**However, many teams don't break their stories down into tasks.** I
have found that splitting stories into tasks encourages teams to split
work horizontally, whereas we try to [slice work
vertically](http://scrumandkanban.co.uk/slicing-stories-vertically/ "Slicing stories vertically").
