# **Capability Maturity Model (CMM)**
The **Capability Maturity Model** (**CMM**) is a methodology used to develop and refine an organization&apos;s software development process. 

As an organization we want to help shape teams to increase their process maturity to be as efficient as possible.

The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a proven industry framework process and behavioral model that helps organizations streamline process improvement and encourage productive, efficient behaviors that decrease risks in software, product, and service development. CMM provides a structure for the organization to identify a baseline on the current capabilities, understand where the current workforce planning, establishing a foundation for consistent evaluation. It enables the organization to make better, well-informed decisions about how to support progression and what investments to make in.

The goal for CMM is to create reliable environments, where products, service and departments are proactive, efficient and productive.

CMM is a benchmark for measuring the maturity of an squad, tribe and organization. It is a methodology used to develop and refine the organization process. CMM can be used to assess and the different levels within the organization against the five maturity levels.


# **Value**
- To assess any engineering team, understand how it works, what kind of problems does it have and how to fix those problems
- To achieve transparency about the level of engineering capabilities and maturity across all tribes and establish sustainable improvements process
- To understand the correlation between established engineering culture and business value through the collection and analysis of metrics and other engineering data
- Delivery Key **Metrics** are identified and collected and serve to support the Capability Areas defined for high performing technology, teams and processes.

# **Benefits**
Benefits to using a process improvement framework, such as the CMM, have been identified by numerous researchers, both academic and professional, and would include:

- More accurate identification of flaws in process development operations
- Reduction in cost of software development or management of data as a resource
- Increase in productivity from software development and / or data management professionals (staff and contractors)
- Reduction in post-release defects and essential enhancements
- Reduction in time-to-market for implementation.

The CMM is intended to be a cohesive, coherent, ordered set of incremental improvements, all relating to experienced success in the field, and packaged into a framework that demonstrates how effective practices can be built on one another into a logical and repeatable progression. Far from a &quot;quick fix,&quot; successful use of the CMM requires attention to detail, support, and participation from senior management and a rational approach to all aspects of software development or data management, and implementation.

# **Levels**
Levels serve as the pillars of the CMM visualization (Heat Map) shows the achieved levels and the improvement path towards continues improvement (Major level: L1, L3, L5; Transition level: L2, L4)

                    At this level, describes processes that are continually monitored and improved as needed. Your processes should always remain flexible enough to accommodate new technologies and innovation in the organization. Development processes aren&apos;t meant to be static and the fifth and final level of maturity isn&apos;t an end-point. Organizations still need to maintain a constant focus on process performance to maintain that appraisal level.
                    <br/>
                    Here, an organization&apos;s processes are stable and flexible. At this final stage, an organization will be in constant state of improving and responding to changes or other opportunities. The organization is stable, which allows for more &quot;agility and innovation,&quot; in a predictable environment.

                    <br/>
                    These processes have been repeatedly tested, refined and adapted in multiple conditions across the organization. All key stakeholders and process users are competent in the established process and comfortable deploying it in various environments. By now, your process should easily adapt to suit other projects in the organization and to stand as a template for future process development.
                    <br/>
                    This level is more measured and controlled. The organization is working off quantitative data to determine predictable processes that align with stakeholder needs. The business is ahead of risks, with more data-driven insight into process deficiencies.

                    At this level, the organization has processes that are &quot;well characterized and understood and are described in standards, procedures, tools and methods,&quot;. Processes should be well-defined and documented, and they should be continually improved to some extent over time. This level brings more organization and standardization to your process by establishing reliability and efficiency.
                    <br/>
                    Organizations are more proactive than reactive. There&apos;s a set of &quot;organization-wide standards&quot; to &quot;provide guidance across projects, programs and portfolios.&quot; Businesses understand their shortcomings, how to address them and what the goal is for improvement.

                    At this level, an organization&apos;s development processes are repeatable and produce consistent results. At this stage, all business projects are managed so that processes are &quot;planned, performed, measured and controlled,&quot;.  The focus is on the management of requirements, processes, work products and services. You want to ensure all stakeholders are established and given ownership over specific tasks.
                    <br/>
                    Processes should be able to withstand a stress test to prove that even when things in the organization aren&apos;t running smoothly, the processes still produce consistent and measurable results.
                    <br/>
                    There&apos;s a level of project management achieved. Projects are &quot;planned, performed, measured and controlled&quot; at this level, but there are still a lot of issues to address.

                    At this level, the organization process is typically an unstable environment, where an organization is highly reactive and putting out fires. In this setting, processes are typically ad hoc and the business is relying on specific individuals to keep things afloat. Processes are new and often undocumented — and businesses are unable to reliably repeat processes. This is the starting point for a process your organization plans to repeat — before you&apos;ve ironed out all the kinks and established a routine.
                    <br/>
                    All businesses start at the initial stage when creating a new development process. Once you&apos;ve repeated — or attempted to repeat — the process, you&apos;ll discover unexpected roadblocks to address, adjustments to make and metrics to track. You&apos;ll naturally progress to higher levels through trial and error, as they will help inform improvements.
                    <br/>
                    Processes are viewed as unpredictable and reactive. At this stage, &quot;work gets completed but it&apos;s often delayed and over budget.&quot; This is the worst stage a business can find itself in — an unpredictable environment that increases risk and inefficiency.
