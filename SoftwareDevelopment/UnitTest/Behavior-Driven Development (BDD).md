# Information Technology : Behavior-Driven Development (BBD)


Is a set of best practices for writing great tests. BDD can, and should
be, used together with TDD and unit testing methods.

One of the key things BDD addresses is implementation detail in unit
tests. A common problem with poor unit tests is they rely too much on
how the tested function is implemented. This means if you update the
function, even without changing the inputs and outputs, you must also
update the test. This is a problem because it makes doing changes
tedious.

Behavior-Driven Development addresses this problem by showing you how to
test. You should not test implementation, but instead behavior.
