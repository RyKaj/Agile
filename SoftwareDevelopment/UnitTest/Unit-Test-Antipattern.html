<ul>
<li><p>Using nondeterministic factors in the codebase: Such scenarios are
difficult to test especially when they don't reproduce/hold a
constant value on each rerun. Eg Using Time as an authentication
measure in code which would vary at each moment and also in
different time zones.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using side-effecting methods: Testing these could be as difficult as
testing methods with a nondeterministic factor in them. Poorly
designed untestable code introduce unwarranted complexities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Impurity is highly toxic: Method depending upon nondeterministic or
side-effecting methods themselves become the same kind and in the
end complicate the entire codebase. Considering the effect it may
have on a real-life complex application, we may find ourselves
trapped in codebase filled with antipatterns, secret dependencies
and all sorts of unpleasant scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mocking interfaces and classes outside the codebase: If you don't
fully understand the proper usage of an interface, you should avoid
mocking it. Rather you should wrap interaction with external API
classes into specially created interfaces for the same purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Working with the mutable global state: Method depending upon mutable
global state not only requires you to consider the current value but
also be updated about other code that may have altered its value
earlier. Hence its advisable to avoid them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
