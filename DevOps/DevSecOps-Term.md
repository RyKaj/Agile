## What is DevOps

DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users. The contraction of “Dev” and “Ops” refers to replacing soiled Development and Operations to create multidisciplinary teams that now work together with shared and efficient practices and tools. Essential DevOps practices include agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications.

DevOps is a **culture** in an organization where the delivery of the software is done much faster and efficient than the normal software delivery time. The Development and the operation team of the organization work together through the culture and mindset of the DevOps. In DevOps world, the continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous production happens in every build using the automated tools. The **cultural philosophies**, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market. DevOps culture stresses small, multidisciplinary teams, who work autonomously and take collective accountability for how actual users experience their software. For a DevOps team, _there’s no place like production._ Everything they do is about making customers’ live experience better.

DevOps teams apply agile practices and include operations in the team responsibility. Teams work in small batches, focus on improving the end-to-end delivery of customer value, and strive to eliminate waste and impediments along the way. There are no silos and no blame game, because the team is mutually accountable.

DevOps teams apply a _growth mindset_. They make beliefs explicit, hypothesize impact to create better results, and implement the hypotheses as experiments. DevOps teams use monitoring and telemetry to gather evidence in production and observe results in real time. When evidence diminishes hypotheses, the experiences become opportunities to _fail fast_ or gather validated learning quickly from the experiment. When evidence supports hypotheses, the team uses the opportunity to persevere, or double down, on the actions that lead to improvement.

In transitioning to DevOps, teams shift their priority from optimizing mean time between failure (MTBF) to mean time to mitigate (MTTM) and mean time to remediate (MTTR). Unlike in the past, when lengthy processes were designed to prevent changes that might lead to problems in the field, DevOps teams stress being able to move fast, understand the impact and react quickly.

DevOps teams think in terms of competencies, not roles. While they include both developmental and operational skills and awareness, they share responsibility for running the live site. That means that developers on the team accept responsibility for the health of the running services and will rotate time on-call. The principle is, if you build it, you run it.

## What is DevSecOps

The term DevSecOps refers to a development and operations concept which integrates and emphasizes secure design as well as security automation throughout the continuous software development and delivery life cycle. DevSecOps ultimately strives for achieving a software development and delivery pipeline that is _secure_ _by default_. This blog post will briefly cover the concepts and philosophy behind DevSecOps.

Software developers in fast moving environments are probably aware of the rate at which development operations move. It goes something like this: one minute, you are riffing and writing code — the next — the code which you just wrote has already been pushed to production and is being served to end users and clients. In such an environment, it becomes important to not end up giving security a back seat. Security has the potential to be neglected when the processes associated with it are tedious and manual — and when such processes are placed in the care of only a minor subset of organizational staff, i.e., the security team. The DevSecOps philosophy makes a bid to consciously lessen security negligence, mainly by — moving away from manual testing — toward leveraging automated processes — while also making security something that everyone in the organization has to care about.

The DevSecOps philosophy asserts that shifting security toward the left of the continuous development and delivery life cycle would save both cost and time. Shifting security to the left of the process may ultimately lessen the number of security issues that would otherwise be found after the code has been deployed. At a glance, DevSecOps has the potential to help with the following:

*   cost of redeployment — along with the associated processes that have to be followed after the fact;
*   time spent on development — as compared to making changes when bugs are identified at build-time;
*   the stigma associated with writing bad code — some developers may prefer to have their errors pointed out by automated testing systems, as opposed to their colleagues — for which static application security testing at build time may be a solution;
*   external identification and potential exploitation of a particular bug — that may have otherwise been caught during the development life cycle.

## Some benefits of DevOps, or rather, DevSecOps provides.

*   Security joining directly toward the start
    

In DevOps forms, security can be joined from a beginning time itself, and not toward the part of the bargaining procedure. It turns into a need on the off chance that you need to make sure about running a quality programming conveyance process. Simply the manner in which Continuous Integration permits ‘moving left’ by accelerating testing to find bugs prior all the while, DevOps procedures can likewise mix computerized security testing and consistency.

*   Quick issue fixes

Security break is a periodic locating, however, ought to be paid attention to. You have to take activities immediately when such cases emerge.

DevOps helps in quickening the lead time, enabling you to construct, test, and convey the update all the more quickly. Aside from that, numerous DevOps stages empower cautious following everything being equal, pipelines, and conditions which quickens and rearranges your reaction by an extraordinary edge when you have to reveal your update.

It is simpler to distinguish the segment that should be refreshed when you know which adaptation of the application is conveyed on which condition and what all segments are in its stack. It helps in discharging your updates rapidly in a progressively steady way.

*   Security incorporation all through the procedure

Organizations can have authority over the whole advancement cycle and addition permeability by using apparatuses that are shared crosswise over various capacities. It is better with a DevOps computerization stage that spotlights on the improvement, testing, operations, and security, start to finish. This changes the computerized pipeline in a shut circle process to test, revealing, and settling issues identified with security.

*   A  single click compliance reporting

A single click consistence revealing mechanized procedures are invaluable with regards to being predictable. Alongside having unsurprising results for comparable tests and activities, these robotized procedures can be logged consequently.

Directly from the code change to the last discharge, DevOps gives strong detectability. A solid DevOps framework makes inspecting much simpler. On the off chance that you need to computerize things, from structure and testing to conveying and discharging, your DevOps robotization stage can give you a huge amount of data that it approaches, which is archived consequently. This data goes about as your security log, review trail, and consistency report produced naturally with no manual intercession.

*   Efficiency of developers

DevOps puts light on the centrality of streamlining forms over the pipeline. This prompts consistency being developed, trying, and discharge rehearses in a predictable way. To make designers independent, your DevOps apparatuses, just as, the robotization can be arranged while guaranteeing access control and consistency.

*   Increased communication & collaboration between teams
*   Identify vulnerabilities in code at the beginning before it’s too late
*   Speed up the process and quick response to changes
*   Increased bandwidth for teams to focus on high-value tasks
*   Increased accountability among teams for security
*   Cost reduction since security challenges are detected and averted early on in the development phase

## DevSecOps Manifesto

Similarly to DevOps, DevSecOps can also be called a culture of its own. DevSecOps is a philosophy of integrating security methods into a DevOps process. Team work is as crucial to a DevSecOps engineer as it is to a DevOps engineer: their ability to resolve conflicts and conduct productive negotiations plays a crucial role in creating secure applications. From the very start of a SDLC, DevSecOps works to make the application secure by introducing a variety of security techniques.

Through Security as Code, we have and will learn that there is simply a better way for security practitioners, like us, to operate and contribute value with less friction. We know we must adapt our ways quickly and foster innovation to ensure data security and privacy issues are not left behind because we were too slow to change.

By developing security as code, we will strive to create awesome products and services, provide insights directly to developers, and generally favor iteration over trying to always come up with the best answer before a deployment. We will operate like developers to make security and compliance available to be consumed as services. We will unlock and unblock new paths to help others see their ideas become a reality.

We won't simply rely on scanners and reports to make code better. We will attack products and services like an outsider to help you defend what you've created. We will learn the loopholes, look for weaknesses, and we will work with you to provide remediation actions instead of long lists of problems for you to solve on your own.

We will not wait for our organizations to fall victim to mistakes and attackers. We will not settle for finding what is already known; instead, we will look for anomalies yet to be detected. We will strive to be a better partner by valuing what you value:

*   **Leaning in** over Always Saying “No”
*   **Data & Security Science** over Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt
*   **Open Contribution & Collaboration** over Security-Only Requirements
*   **Consumable Security Services with APIs** over Mandated Security Controls & Paperwork
*   **Business Driven Security Scores** over Rubber Stamp Security
*   **Red & Blue Team Exploit Testing** over Relying on Scans & Theoretical Vulnerabilities
*   **24x7 Proactive Security Monitoring** over Reacting after being Informed of an Incident
*   **Shared Threat Intelligence** over Keeping Info to Ourselves
*   **Compliance Operations** over Clipboards & Checklists
