# Quality Assurance (QA) : Finding Defects

How can I find a bug?

Most applications and websites have similar features, such as: a
homepage, sign up, login, my account, search, check out and so on. When
testing, and searching for bugs try to use the app as a normal user
would use it in the real world. Keep an eye out for anything that
doesn't seem to be working, or is doing something completely different
than a normal user would expect. Here are some examples of things to do
while testing:

## User registration and login

  - Log in using Google and Facebook accounts
  - Register a regular email account
  - Try to register using invalid credentials (note this is not always
    in scope)
  - Use the forgot password feature to retrieve your account

## My account page

  - Change your password
  - Upload a profile image and change the image too
  - Change and apply all of the different account settings
  - See that all pages and features in the account page are available
    and functional

## Checkout, cart, wish list

  - Add and remove items from the cart
  - Add and remove items from the wish list
  - Like different items (and try to remove the like too)
  - Click on the checkout button to verify the items in your cart (Do
    notÂ complete purchases while testing)

## Homepage

  - Click on all of the different buttons, links and features
  - Observe all images are displayed correctly and respond as expected
  - Menu - verify that a user can navigate through the features of the
    website or app
  - Design - verify the page is aligned properly to the screen's default
    size

## Search and Filter

  - Use the search functionality and to explore the features, products
    and various pages
  - Try searching with invalid data (spaces or with no input, note this
    may not be in scope)
  - Select different colors, sizes and designs of products
  - Apply multiple filters at one time
  - Use the remove all filters button
  - Open the filtered results and return back (observe the filter
    behavior)
  - Verify filters show the correct amount of results

## Footer links

  - About us page
  - Contact us page
  - Sitemap - links to all the pages on the product (useful for getting familiar with a website)
