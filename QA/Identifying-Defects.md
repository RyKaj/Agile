# Quality Assurance (QA) : Identifying Defects

## Defect Types

A bug or "issue" is an unexpected behavior or malfunction in the
functionality or design of a product.  
Put simply, a bug is something that isn't working quite right. For
example, have you ever experienced an app suddenly quit when you tap a
button? Or maybe you have tried to upload a new profile picture, but
after 19 uploads the app still shows an empty space where your face
should be? Well, those were bugs.

Bug types can be summed up into 5 categories:

### Functional

Functional issues are workflow failures where something in the test
application did not work as it was design to. These issues produce an
unexpected or illogical application behavior where the end result
differs from the expected result.

Examples:

  - Broken page links
  - Search and filters return incorrect results
  - Button does not respond when clicked

### Visual

Visual issues affect the layout and cause user interface distortion such
as missing elements or images on a page.

Examples:

  - Page elements or content is misaligned
  - Content does not fit the area it is in
  - Inconsistent colors on a link, button or menu
  - Picture is missing

### Content

Content issues affect the text of a page, such as spelling, grammar and
localization errors.

Examples:

  - Localization issues where the wrong word is used in page
    translations
  - Spelling and capitalization errors such as mikeJones
  - Punctuation is used incorrectly in text ( , . : ; ' " )

### Performance

Problematic slowness or hanging, sluggish interface. Features take
longer to load than they should, slow navigation in the application.  
Examples:

  - Application reacts slowly when navigating throughout features
  - Application or pages take too long to load
  - Application freezes or becomes unresponsive

### Crash

Application quits or closes unexpectedly while using the features.  
Examples:

  - Web - page hangs and doesn't respond, ultimately resulting with an
    error, or the browser closes
  - Computer - application freezes the device, hangs for a long time or
    closes abruptly
  - Mobile - applications close abruptly with an error
