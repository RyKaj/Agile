# Quality Assurance (QA) : Test Case Review Checklist

1.  **Spelling mistakes:**
      - Sometimes, spelling mistake can create a lot of confusions or
        make a sentence difficult to understand.
2.  **Grammar:**
      - If grammar is not proper then test case can be interpreted in a
        wrong way, resulting in wrong results.
3.  **Template format:**
      - If proper template is followed then it becomes easy to
        add/modify test cases in future and test case plan looks
        organized.
4.  **Standard/Guidelines:**
      - While review process, it is very important to check whether all
        the standards and guideline are properly followed.
5.  **Language used:**
      - *Test cases*Â should have a very simple language which is easy to
        understand.
6.  **Functionality coverage:**
      - It is highly recommended that all the functionality associated
        with the system under test should be covered so that major
        defects are not missed.
7.  **Replication:**
      - It refers to the duplicate test cases removal. It is possible
        that two or more test cases test the same thing and can be
        merged into one, this would save time and space.
8.  **Redundancy:**
      - It refers to uselessness of a test case due to change in
        requirements or some modifications. Such test cases must be
        removed.
