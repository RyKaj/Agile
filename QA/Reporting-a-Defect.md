# Quality Assurance (QA) :Reporting a Defect

Writing a quality bug report is a learned skill that takes time and
practice to develop. You should keep in mind the tips below when writing
bug reports.

## Recreate the bug numerous times to understand it

Before you begin writing a bug report, make sure to recreate the bug
numerous times so that you understand it well and can explain these
three things clearly:

  - What the bug is
  - How to recreate it
  - What happens when the bug is recreated

## Testers need to explain bugs clearly and provide proof

As a tester, it is your job to explain the bug clearly and provide proof
of the bug so that the TTL or customer can recreate and understand it.

## The bug title explains what the bug is

Write the title that clearly explains what the bug is.

## Numbered steps explaining how to recreate the bug

Write numbered steps that describe exactly what a user has to do to
recreate the bug.

## Clearly explain what was expected and what happened

Clearly explain the expected and actual results of the bug. That means
what the user expected to happen and then what did happen, when carrying
out the steps.

## Create and include all required proof of the bug

Finally, create and include all required (useful) attachments:

  - Screenshots
  - Screen recordings
  - Device logs

Record your steps.

## Review and fix any error in the bug report

Take the time to read, review and fix any mistakes inside of your bug
report before you submit it.

## If written incorrectly the QA Lead will ask you to fix the bug report

If you have written it incorrectly, the QA Lead will reach out to you to
fix the report or add additional information.

## Remember to check

Make sure to check:

  - Bug title
  - Numbered steps
  - Expected and actual results
  - Attachments. Make sure to upload all of the required attachments
