**Theme**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

Are large focus areas that span the organization.  Is an organization
goal that drive the creation of epics and initiatives.

A collection of stories by category. A basket or bucket of stories. By
its nature, an epic can also be a theme in itself.

However, interestingly, one group thought that themes should refer to
business goals. My view is that everything should have a goal (otherwise
why are you doing it?\!)

</div>

</div>

<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Epic**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of
smaller
[stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories),
or sometimes called “Issues” in Jira. Epics often encompass multiple
teams, on multiple projects, and can even be tracked on multiple boards.
Epics are almost always delivered over a set of sprints. As a team
learns more about an epic through development and customer feedback,
user stories will be added and removed as necessary. That’s the key with
agile epics: Scope is flexible, based on customer feedback and team
cadence.

An epic is a big story. A requirement that is just too big to deliver in
a single sprint. Epics need to be broken into smaller deliverables
(stories). This helps them support [the agile
principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) (e.g. delivering
working software frequently, early continuous delivery, regular
reflection).

<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Features**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

A distinguishing characteristic or capability of a software application
or library (e.g., performance, portability, or functionality).

</div>

</div>

<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**User Story**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It’s an
end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user’s perspective.

Use Story often follow the **SMART** acronym: specific, measurable,
achievable, relevant, time-boxed (although what the letters stand for
seems to be hotly debated).

The purpose of a user story is articulate how a piece of work will
deliver a particular value back to the customer. Note that "customers"
don't have to be external end users in the traditional sense, they can
also be internal customers or colleagues within your organization who
depend on your team.

User stories are a few sentences in simple language that outline the
desired outcome. They don't go into detail. Requirements are added
later, once agreed upon by the team.

Stories fit neatly into agile frameworks like scrum and kanban. In
scrum, user stories are added to sprints and “burned down” over the
duration of the sprint. Kanban teams pull user stories into their
backlog and run them through their workflow. It’s this work on user
stories that help scrum teams get better at
[estimation](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation)
and sprint planning, leading to more accurate forecasting and greater
agility. Thanks to stories, kanban teams learn how to manage
work-in-progress (WIP) and can further refine their workflows.

User stories are also the building blocks of larger agile frameworks
like epics and initiatives. Epics are large work items broken down into
a set of stories, and multiple epics comprise an initiative. These
larger structures ensure that the day to day work of the development
team (on stores) contributes to the organizational goals built into
epics and initiatives.

A story is an individual feature or requirement that the client (and
business) wants. It is something that is deliverable (i.e. production
ready) within a single sprint. A story should use the INVEST acronym

**Task**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

> **Task are not created by the Scrum Master or Product Owner. This is

> self-organized.**

Decide which specific steps need to be completed and who is responsible
for each of them.

The elements of a story. Stepping stones to take the story to ‘Done’.

**However, many teams don’t break their stories down into tasks.** I
have found that splitting stories into tasks encourages teams to split
work horizontally, whereas we try to [slice work
vertically](http://scrumandkanban.co.uk/slicing-stories-vertically/ "Slicing stories vertically").

PROJ Board - Is the board where Product Owners/Business Analysis create
Epics.  Epics are large chunks of work that has one common objective -
business requirements / feature. Epics are also Corporation Portfolio.

CUS / WEB / PAY Boards - Examples of different development teams -
regardless of their department/specialties. This is where the Stories of
the Epics will managed and process.

As you can see from the diagram, all departments and teams have full
visibility on status, progress, and any dependency.

Scaled Agile Framework addresses the problems encountered when scaling
agile beyond a single team.  SAFe promotes collaboration, coordination,
and delivery across a large number of agile teams. This framework
leverages three primary bodies of knowledge:

  - Agile software development
  - Lean product development
  - System thinking

Scaled Agile Framework SAFe, is a freely available online knowledge base
that allows you to apply lean-agile practices at the enterprise level.
It provides a simple, lightweight experience for the software
development team. The whole framework is divided into three segments 
**Team, Program and Portfolio**. We will see this in detail later on

  - Implementing Lean-Agile software and systems in enterprise level
  - It's based on Lean and Agile principles.
  - It gives detailed guidance for work at the enterprise Portfolio,
    Value Stream, Program, and Team.
  - It's designed to meet the needs of all stakeholders within an
    organization.

SAFe was first developed in the field and was elaborated in  **Dean
Leffingwell'**s books and blog. Version 1.0 is the first official
release in 2011. The latest version is 4.6, was released in October
2018. It provides guidance to work at enterprise Portfolio, Value
Stream, Program, and Team levels.

These five competencies are:

1.  **Lean agile leadership:** Leaders should drive and support
    organizational change and operational effectiveness. Ultimately, it
    is the leadership team that has the authority to influence
    individuals and teams to achieve their potential.
2.  **Team and technical agility:** Teams must possess certain vital
    skills and adhere to Lean agile practices to create well-designed
    solutions quickly. Ensuring the technical agility of teams is
    especially important as they are the ones who ultimately perform the
    actual work that will be delivered to your customers.
3.  **DevOps and release on demand:** The establishment of a continual,
    ongoing pipeline for deliverables is vital for creating value to
    meet your customers’ needs.
4.  **Business solutions and Lean systems engineering:** The more
    organizations facilitate Lean agile practices to drive blueprints,
    development and deployment, the more innovative they can be.
5.  **Lean portfolio management:** A sound organizational strategy that
    includes financial considerations, portfolio management and
    compliance-related aspects is essential to SAFe success.

## When to Use Scaled Agile Framework

  - When a team is interested to implement an agile approach
    consistently across larger, multi-team programs and portfolios.
  - When multiple teams are running their own way of Agile
    implementation but regularly facing obstacles, delays, and failures.
  - When teams want to work independently.
  - When you want to scale Agile across the organization but not sure
    what new roles may be needed or what existing roles (i.e.,
    management) need to change and how.
  - When you have attempted to scale the Agile across your organization
    but struggling in alignment to achieve uniform or consistent
    strategy across business departments from portfolio to program and
    team levels.
  - When an organization needs to improve its product development lead
    time and want to know how other companies have succeeded in scaling
    Agile with SAFe.

## How different than other Agile practices

  - It's publicly available and free to use.
  - Available in a highly approachable and usable form.
  - It's lightweight, practically proven results and specific to level.
  - It constantly/regularly modifies/maintains most commonly used agile
    practices.
  - Offers useful extensions to common agile practices.
  - Grounds agile practices to an enterprise context.
  - Offers complete picture of software development.
  - Visibility or transparency is more on all the levels.
  - Continues or regular feedback on quality and improvement.

SAFe Formation

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1011077322" class="expand-content">

Let's start our discussion on Scaled Agile Framework and its formation.
By now, we have clearly articulated and understood the need to have a
Scaled Agile Framework in an organization.

Now, conceptualize an environment where we have multiple teams working
under similar conditions to achieve the same objective. It is time for
us to move ahead and see how Agile Scaled Framework such as Scaled Scrum
works in this space.

  - All the stakeholders (Internal or External) and management come
    along together to create a very high-level Portfolio Vision Document
    which is also called as Portfolio Backlog. Portfolio Backlog is
    essentially consisting of multiple Business and architectural
    requirements which is also known as Epics. These business and
    architectural epics are aligned with priorities.

![Epic](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/Epic.png)

  - Based on the priorities, these epics are picked up by the Product
    Managers/Delivery Managers. They create a well-defined Roadmap and a
    Vision Document. They do this activity by discussing the release
    plan with the Release Management Team to align the roadmap with the
    production releases.
  - Once the Roadmap and Vision Document is created, the Product
    Manager’s next step is to create a backlog of Program Backlog. A
    Program Backlog consists of Release Items, Functional bits and a
    pool of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs).
  - The Release Management Team prepares a release plan to fit in the
    features in the release cycles.
  - The Release Management Team now works on the feature bits to fulfill
    the Release Plan and objectives. They also work on preparing the
    architecture and infrastructure to enable smooth releases.
  - From the Program Backlog, we move towards an individual Product
    Backlog which is also known as Team Backlog. Release/System Team
    have their own Product Backlog, similarly, all the Scrum Team
    working on the project will have their individual Product Backlog.
  - Product Backlog consists of both functional and non-functional
    stories. These stories are prioritized by the Product Owner who is
    working on that Scrum Team.
  - Typically there are 5-10 Scrum Teams that are working in a Scaled
    Agile Environment. Each of the Scrum Team has a Product Owner, Scrum
    Master, and a Development Team. The roles and responsibilities of
    each of the Scrum Team Member in Scaled Scrum are the same as that
    in the normal Scrum Environment.
  - The Scrum Team performs all the Scrum Ceremonies and works on
    developing the Increment to be delivered at the end of each sprint.

  

### Core Values

Alignment, Built-in Quality, Alignment and Transparency

  - Communication and Collaboration between the Scrum Teams is the key
    to a successful Scaled Scrum in terms of productivity, quality and
    time to market.

A few tweaks here and there in a Scrum Framework can lead to incredible
results in the form of Scaled Scrum.

SAFe Configuration

</div>

<div id="expander-content-183875429" class="expand-content">

The below image explains how agile process works. Epics are a large body
of work, which is further broken down into a number of smaller stories
or sub-epics. These sub-epics are allocated to the team as a story. Each
team then work on these stories or software features accordingly. SAFe
supports the full range of development environments with four
configurations,

![SAFe
Configuration](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/SAFe-Configuration.png)![](attachments/463506521/471992241.png)

### 1\. Essential SAFe

  - The Essential SAFe configuration is the heart of the Framework and
    is the simplest starting point for implementation.
  - It’s the basic building block for all other SAFe configurations and
    describes the most critical elements that are required to realize
    the majority of the Framework’s benefits.
  - The Team and Program Levels form an organizational structure called
    the Agile Release Train (ART), where Agile teams, key stakeholders,
    and other resources are dedicated to an important, ongoing solution
    mission.

### 2\. Portfolio SAFe

  - The Portfolio SAFe configuration helps to align portfolio execution
    to the enterprise strategy.
  - Organized around the flow of value.
  - Lean-Agile budgeting empowers decision makers.
  - Kanban system provides portfolio visibility and WIP limits.
  - Enterprise architecture guides larger technology decisions.
  - Objective metrics support governance and improvement.
  - Value delivery via Epics.

### 3\. Large Solution SAFe

  - Large Solution SAFe configuration is for developing the largest and
    most complex solutions that typically require multiple Agile release
    trains and Suppliers, but do not require portfolio-level
    considerations.
  - This is common for industries like aerospace, defense, automotive
    etc.
  - The Solution Train organizational construct of the Large Solution
    Level helps enterprises that face the biggest challenges—building
    large-scale, multidisciplinary software, hardware, and complex IT
    systems.
  - Building these solutions requires additional roles, artifacts,
    events, and coordination.

### 4\. Full SAFe

  - The Full SAFe configuration is the most comprehensive version of the
    Framework.
  - It supports enterprises that build and maintain large integrated
    solutions, that require hundreds of people or more, and includes all
    levels of SAFe: team, program, large solution, and portfolio.
  - In largest enterprises, multiple instances of various SAFe
    configurations may be required.

## Lean-Agile Leaders  

Management has the ultimate responsibility for business outcomes.
Leaders must be trained, and then become trainers of, these leaner ways
of thinking and operating. To this end, SAFe describes a new style of
leadership that is exhibited by the enterprise’s leaders.

Lean-Agile leaders lead his\\her Organization in building better systems
through iterative and incremental ways of learning, coaching, developing
people and processes.

![SAFe Lean-Agile
Leaders](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2018/09/SAFe-Lean-Agile-Leaders.png)

SAFe Lean-Agile Leaders are lifelong learners and teachers who help the
teams to build better systems through understanding and exhibiting the
Lean-Agile Mindset and SAFe Principles

## Core Values  

Four core values define the belief system for SAFe:

### Program Execution

  - Program execution is the most important core values as it compares
    to other values without which the execution team cannot deliver any
    value to the customer.
  - Mainly it focuses on working software and great customer experience.
  - Complex software development is accomplished with the help of
    inspecting and adept at the end and performs better in every PI.
  - Not only the teams but with the help of Agile leaders, the
    leadership team can also perform customer satisfaction

### Transparency

  - At every level i.e. team, program, value stream, and portfolio level
    we have a whiteboard which displays information about project
    progress at any point of time.
  - The team follows agile scrum, hence all the team members trust each
    other and are free to take decisions which foster innovations.
  - Encourages open and honest communication with all stakeholders.
  - Value productivity, quality, transparency, and openness over
    internal politics.

### Built-in Quality

  - Incrementally adopt the Built-in Quality practices for software,
    hardware, and firmware. Understand, teach, or sponsor technical
    skills development in support of high-quality code, components,
    systems, and solutions.
  - Foster Communities of Practice.
  - Understand, support, and apply Agile Architecture and Lean User
    Experience (UX)

## Lean-Agile Mindset

<div id="expander-1856848550" class="expand-container">

SAFe Manifesto

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1856848550" class="expand-content">

These basic principles and values for SAFe must be understood, exhibited
and continued in order to get the desired results.

  - Take an economic view
  - Apply systems thinking
  - Assume variability; preserve options
  - Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles
  - Base milestones on an objective evaluation of working systems
  - Visualize and limit WIP, reduce batch sizes and manage queue lengths
  - Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
  - Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
  - Decentralize decision-making

Lean-Agile Leaders are lifelong learners and teachers. They understand
and embrace Lean and Agile principles & practices.

![Lean-Agile

**Our Lean-Agile mindset is represented in two things:**

**(i) The House of Lean:**

The House of Lean is the one which you see here.

**It has a number of elements:**

**Value,** as the goal of Lean is very simple, it has the shortest
sustainable lead time. That's accomplished by the pillars of **respect
for people and culture**, product development flow, innovation—critical
to long-term sustainability—and relentless improvement. And it's
supported by **leadership**.

That's the structure in which we tend to think about the Lean paradigm.

  

Everything else is the same as Agile Manifesto

>     “agile” is a state of being, not a process. It is a feeling that drives development and delivery. In teams I would consider agile, none of them operated exactly like the others; and some actions that would improve agility in one team would harm it in another. Some companies are able to mimic that feeling by embracing agile principles, and others aren’t. The important part isn’t the specific methodology that others say will help you achieve max productivity for your team, it’s the process that aligns with your culture and your software and your customer.

# Agile

Agile is an umbrella term used to describe a project management
methodology which breaks down large complex projects into smaller
manageable chunks. Agile project management has been used in software
development to speed up the completion of projects, but now, we see
these practices being applied in a multitude of industries. "
<span class="underline">Agile is a set of guiding principles developed
in 2001 published as the </span> <span class="underline">[Agile
Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)</span> <span class="underline">.
Scrum and Kanban, on the other hand, are two methodologies which are
considered to be Agile. Or to put it another way, if you want to work in
an agile fashion, Scrum and Kanban are two ways to do it.</span>” said
Nicholas Carrier, Associate Partner at London-based 
[Prophet](https://www.prophet.com/) .  

A structured and iterative approach to project management and product
development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and
provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change
without going off the rails. Today, agile is hardly a competitive
advantage. No one has the luxury to develop a product for years or even
months in a black box. This means it’s more important than ever to get
it right.

Agile software development is based on an incremental, iterative
approach. Instead of in-depth planning at the beginning of the project,
Agile methodologies are open to changing requirements over time and
encourages constant feedback from the end users. Cross-functional teams
work on iterations of a product over a period of time, and this work is
organized into a backlog that is prioritized based on business or
customer value. The goal of each iteration is to produce a working
product.

In Agile methodologies, leadership encourages teamwork, accountability,
and face-to-face communication. Business stakeholders and developers
must work together to align the product with customer needs and company
goals.

**12 Principles**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

1.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
    continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile
    processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3.  Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a
    couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4.  Business people and developers must work together daily throughout
    the project.
5.  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the
    environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job
    done.
6.  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to
    and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors,
    developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace
    indefinitely.
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
    enhances agility.
10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is
    essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
    self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
    effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

**Agile Leadership**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

1.  When there are leadership and guidance, not command & control.
2.  When there is alignment across the organization instead of the
    pursuit of local optimization efforts or personal agendas.
3.  When the collaboration of all participants beyond hierarchies is the
    norm, not an exception.
4.  When we acknowledge that management principles of the 19th century
    are unsuited to solve complex problems of the 21st century.
5.  When managers become servant leaders.

The following paragraphs focus on the main concepts related to agile
leadership: from servant leadership to the agile mindset to creating a
learning organization. The lists are not supposed to be comprehensive
but provide the interested reader with a starting point for further
research.

Servant Leadership

</div>

<div id="expander-content-417729520" class="expand-content">

“A Servant Leader shares power puts the needs of the employees first and
helps people develop and perform as highly as possible. Instead of the
people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the
people.”

Source:  [Wikipedia on Servant
Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership "Wikipedia on Servant Leadership")
.

Servant leadership is a suitable approach to dealing with complexity.
Complexity — the unknown unknowns — determines decision-making processes
and is characterized by:

  - More unpredictability than predictability.
  - Emergent answers.
  - Many competing ideas.
  - Cause and effect can only be determined in retrospect.

For a much more elaborate approach to complexity, see the  [Cynefin
framework by Dave
Snowden](https://cognitive-edge.com/ "Agile Leadership: Cynefin framework")
.

Servant leadership is not a new concept:

“A leader is best when people barely know he exists when his work is
done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.” ( [Lao
Tzu, 4th century BC.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi) )

Servant leadership is characterized by:

  - Service to others.
  - Promotion of community.
  - Creation of a shared vision.
  - A holistic approach to work.
  - A shared decision-making process.

Servant leadership thus seems suited to overcome the industrial
paradigm. Source:

The principles of intent-based leadership according to David Marquet are
as follows:

  - Create leaders, not followers.
  - Resist the urge to resolve the problems of your people.
  - Take deliberate action.
  - Learn everywhere at any time.
  - Specify goals, not methods.
  - Don’t empower, emancipate.

**Agile Mindset**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

As to what “having an Agile mindset” means, things were initially
unclear. Some resorted to the Supreme Court’s approach to defining
pornography: “You know it when you see it.” Yet over time, the nature
and content of the Agile mindset have clarified, particularly by way of
contrast to the  *bureaucratic mindset* that is still prevalent in many
large organizations.

Practitioners are thus said to have  *an Agile mindset* when they are
preoccupied—and sometimes obsessed—with innovating and delivering
steadily more  *customer* value, with getting work done in small
self-organizing  *teams*, and with collaborating together in an
interactive  *network*. Such organizations have been shown to have the
capacity to adapt rapidly to a quickly shifting marketplace.

The bureaucracy that ensues from such a mindset often finds it hard to
adapt to a world in massive rapid change.

The two different kinds of mindsets exert a powerful influence on the
behavior of their respective organizations and can be seen as having the
*de facto* force of organizational laws, as shown here.

![The Agile mindset vs the bureaucratic
mindset](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fstevedenning%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F08%2Fmindset-table.jpg)

  

It’s not that those with a *bureaucratic mindset* don’t care about the
customer: it’s just that they generally focus more on making money for
the company and its shareholders. Nor do they never use teams; it’s that
in a bureaucracy, self-organizing teams are the exception, not the rule.
Nor is operating as a network unknown in a bureaucracy: it’s just that
maintaining the pyramid of layers and divisions is seen as more
important.

  

A bureaucratic mindset, when shared by tens of thousands of staff, tends
to create a radically different—and less adaptable—kind of organization
than one peopled by those with an Agile mindset.

## Agile As A Professional Mindset

It may be better to think of the Agile mindset as something akin to the
mindset of a profession, such as that of a lawyer, a doctor or an
economist. Thus, lawyers, doctors, and economists think about certain
problems in characteristic ways. They notice certain kinds of
information, data, and concerns in their respective subjects. They
analyze the issues in their respective ways. They pursue their
respective kinds of solutions. These different ways of thinking,
perceiving and acting as lawyers, doctors, and economists, are acquired
over years of training and practice, which in turn generate
characteristic attitudes, values, modes of thought and approaches to
problems. Professional mindsets are not things that can be acquired
overnight or a two-day training course.

Similarly, those managers with an Agile mindset also pay attention to
certain kinds of information, data, and concerns. They analyze problems
in particular ways. They tend to pursue certain kinds of
solutions—focusing on value for customers, working in small teams and
operating as a network. Their ways of thinking, perceiving and acting
are often acquired over a period of years of practice. We should not be
surprised that the Agile mindset too isn’t something that can be
acquired overnight or a two-day training course.

What we are talking about with the Agile mindset is the emergence of
management itself—finally—becoming a real profession.

## The Nature Of The Agile Mindset

The Agile mindset is an attribute of practitioners more than theorists.
It is pragmatic and action-oriented more than a theoretical philosophy.
It goes beyond a set of beliefs and becomes a tool for diagnosis and the
basis for action. It tends to be built on the hard-won knowledge of
experience and crafted from the lessons of trying to cope with massive
change in the face of incomprehensible complexity.

The Agile mindset might also be called a framework, a paradigm, or a
common model. Yet “mindset” seems a better choice of word, reflecting a
coherent tradition of exploration, paths of analysis and patterns of
reasoning.

The Agile mindset reflects ways of thinking that have developed over
time. It is a certain cast of mind that emphasizes some things over
others. It should continue to grow and evolve. It reflects attitudes and
viewpoints that tend to endure. Over time, it leads to people being seen
as having a certain makeup or character. Once we have understood the
Agile mindset, we can anticipate types of behavior that should occur.

The ‘agile mindset’ discussion seems to be centered around five areas:
complexity and planning, delivering value, self-organization, fostering
collaboration, and cross-functionality of teams:

**Creating a Learning Organization**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

Peter Senge is a Senior Lecturer in Leadership and Sustainability at the
MIT Sloan School of Management and coined the term ‘learning
organization’ in his book ‘ [The Fifth
Discipline](https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Learning-Organization/dp/0385517254/ref=sr_1_fkmr2_1 "Peter Senge: The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization")
:’

  - “ [The only sustainable competitive advantage is an organization's
    ability to learn faster than the
    competition](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/21072.Peter_M_Senge "Peter Senge on the Learning Organization")
    .”
  - “People working together at their best. It’s a continuous,
    relentless process.”
  - There are two mindsets that can infiltrate an organization: control
    and learning.

These are the characteristics of a learning organization according to
Peter Senge:

  - System thinking: assessing businesses as a system of bounded
    objects.
  - Personal mastery: the commitment of an individual to the process of
    learning.
  - Mental models: assumptions and generalizations held by individuals
    and organizations.
  - Shared vision: Creating a collective identity to provide focus and
    energy for learning.
  - Team learning: The accumulation of individual learning.

Harvard Business School professor David A. Garvin defines a learning
organization as follows:

  - “A learning organization is an organization skilled at creating,
    acquiring, and transferring knowledge, and at modifying its behavior
    to reflect new knowledge and insights.”
  - New ideas, insights or moments of creativity are necessary to
    trigger organizational change. They are not sufficient, though to
    create a learning organization. The changes to the way work are
    accomplished need to follow suit.

### 4\. SAFe Principles

SAFe practices are grounded in nine principles that synthesize Agile
methods, Lean product development, systems thinking, and decades of
field experience.

1.  Take an economic view
2.  Apply systems thinking
3.  Assume variability, preserve options
4.  Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles.
5.  Base milestones on an objective evaluation of working systems
6.  Visualize and limit WIP, reduce batch sizes, and manage queue
    lengths
7.  Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
8.  Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
9.  Decentralize decision-making

### 5\. Implementation Roadmap  

Implementing the changes that are necessary to become a Lean-Agile
technology enterprise is a substantial change for most companies. SAFe
provides an implementation roadmap to help or guide organizations on
this journey.

Finally, let's discuss implementation. We'll describe that using our
Implementing SAFe 1-2-3 model.

Number 1 is to train the Lean-Agile change agents. We call those SAFe
Program Consultants. With a sufficient staff of Lean-Agile change agents
onsite, and working with your partners, you'll have the ability to train
the executives and leaders and managers who are the people responsible
for managing the people who deliver value.

They'll then be in a position to support the launch of the Agile Release
Trains. And with one train at a time, you'll build that Agile portfolio.

Conclusion

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1367528871" class="expand-content">

**SAFe** is a framework which gives us alignment not only with the
team(lower level) and program level but also helps us align to with
organization strategy(top level) and how a team’s works in adding value
to customers right from the top level.

It is available in different configurations, and companies can take
advantage of it

It can be used by a big organization, and it has got a good feedback
from companies implemented in it, it has got it of rules, values and
principle’s if used correctly, the organization can make customer
delighted and produce software in a shortest sustainable lead time which
adds value.

**Lean Portfolio Management**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

![](https://lm2jj13uhv2157rey3v60xm8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Keystone-LPM-WEB-1.png)  

The Lean Portfolio Management (LPM) competency aligns strategy and
execution by applying Lean and systems thinking approaches to strategy
and investment funding, Agile portfolio operations, and governance.
These collaborations give the enterprise the ability to execute existing
commitments reliably and better enable innovation by building on the
foundation of the four other core competencies.  
  
The reason for Lean Portfolio Management is straightforward: traditional
approaches to portfolio management inhibit the flow of value and
innovation in the enterprise. They were not designed for a global
economy and the impact of digital disruption. This new reality puts
pressure on enterprises to work with a higher degree of uncertainty yet
deliver innovative solutions much faster. Despite this new reality, many
legacy portfolio practices remain. Typically, these include: Annual
planning and rigid budgeting cycles Measures of progress that focus on
document-driven deliverables and task completion, versus objective
measures of value Perpetual overload of demand versus capacity, which
decreases throughput and belies effective strategy Phase-gate approval
processes that don’t mitigate risk and discourage incremental delivery
Project-based funding (moving people to the work) and cost accounting,
which causes friction and unnecessary overhead, finger pointing,
bureaucracy, and delays Overly detailed business cases based on highly
speculative and lagging ROI projections Centralizing and developing
requirements with people who will not be doing the actual implementation
Iron-triangle strangulation (fixed scope, cost, and date projects),
which limits agility and does not optimize the total economic value
Traditional Supplier management and coordination, which favors win-lose
contracts, and focuses on the lowest short-term cost, rather than the
highest lifecycle value Also, when portfolio management is unfamiliar
with software capitalization in Agile, it often impedes the
transformation to Lean-Agile approaches. Clearly, portfolio management
approaches must be modernized to support the new Lean-Agile way of
working. Fortunately, many enterprises have already gone down this path,
and the change patterns are fairly clear, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Most of these will occur naturally in a SAFe transformation, but change
is hard, indeed. Caution and awareness are warranted.

There are SAFe portfolios that manage a set of value streams for a
specific area of the business.  LPM function conducts its work with the
help of a series of three collaborations that include:

  - Strategy and investment funding
  - Agile portfolio operations
  - Lean governance

These collaborations provide the ability to execute existing commitments
reliably and enable innovation to the enterprise by building on the
foundation of four other competencies.

<div id="expander-content-921454857" class="expand-content">

These basic principles and values for SAFe must be understood, exhibited
and continued in order to get the desired results.

  - Take an economic view
  - Apply systems thinking
  - Assume variability; preserve options
  - Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles
  - Base milestones on an objective evaluation of working systems

2\. Core Values

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1354045290" class="expand-content">

The SAFe agile is based on these four values.

#### Alignment

  - SAFe supports alignment.
  - Alignment starts at,
      - Strategic Themes in Portfolio Backlog and
      - Moves down to Vision and Roadmap of Program Backlogs and then
      - Moves to the Team Backlogs.

#### Built-in Quality

  - It ensures that every incremental delivery reflects the quality
    standards.
  - Quality is not "added later" is built in.
  - Built-in quality is a prerequisite of Lean and its mandatory

#### Transparency

  - Transparency is the enabler for trust.
  - SAFe helps the enterprise to achieve transparency at all levels-
    Executives, Portfolio Managers, and other stakeholders.
  - Everyone can see into the portfolio backlog/Kanban, program
    backlogs/Kanban, and Team Backlog/Kanban.
  - Each level has a clear understanding of the PI goals.
  - Train Programs have visibility into the team's backlogs, as well
    other program backlogs
  - Teams and programs have visibility into business and architecture
    Epics. They can see what might be headed their way.

#### Program Execution

  - SAFe places great focus on working systems and resultant business
    outcomes.
  - SAFe is not useful if teams can't execute and continuously deliver
    value.

The Lean-Agile Leaders are lifelong learners and teachers. It helps
teams to build better systems through understanding and exhibiting the
Lean-Agile SAFe Principles.

As an enabler for the teams, the ultimate responsibility is adoption,
success and ongoing improvement of Lean-Agile developments. For the
change and continuous improvement, leaders must be trained.

Leaders need to adopt a new style of leadership. One that truly empowers
and engages individuals and teams to reach their highest potential.

#### Principles of these Lean-Agile Leaders

  - Lead the Change
  - Know the Way; Emphasize Lifelong Learning
  - Develop People
  - Inspire and Align with Mission; Minimize Constraints
  - Decentralize Decision-Making
  - Unlock the Intrinsic Motivation of Knowledge Workers

4\. Lean-Agile Mind-set

</div>

<div id="expander-content-957665684" class="expand-content">

Lean-Agile mindset is represented in two things:

1.  The SAFe House of Lean
2.  Agile Manifesto

## The SAFe House of Lean  

SAFe is derived from Lean manufacturing principles and practices. Based
on these factors SAFe presents the "SAFe House of Lean". It is inspired
by "house" of lean Toyota.

The Goal of lean is unbeatable: To deliver maximum customer value in the
shortest lead time with the highest possible quality to customer

Below figure explains the Goal, Pillars, and Foundation of "SAFe House
of Lean."

### Different Levels of SAFe

There are two different types of SAFe implementation:

1.  **SAFe 4.0 implementation**
2.  **SAFe 3.0 implementation**

<https://www.guru99.com/images/8-2016/090116_0956_WhatisScale8.png>

  - In SAFe 4.0 implementation we have 4-Levels: **Portfolio, Value
    Stream, Program, and Team.**
  - In SAFe 3.0 implementation we have 3-Levels: **Portfolio, Program,
    and Team**
  - 3-Level SAFe is for smaller implementations with 100 or fewer
    people. Programs that do not require significant collaboration.
  - 4-Level SAFe is for solutions that typically require many hundreds
    of practitioners to develop deploy and maintain software.

Portfolio Level

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1980149653" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

The Portfolio Level contains the principles, practices, and roles needed
to initiate and govern a set of development Value Streams. This is where
strategy and investment funding are defined for value streams and their
Solutions. This level also provides Agile portfolio operations and Lean
governance for the people and resources needed to deliver solutions. The
portfolio level aligns enterprise strategy to portfolio execution by
organizing the Lean-Agile Enterprise around the flow of value through
one or more value streams. Delivering the basic budgeting and necessary
governance mechanisms, including Lean Budget Guardrails, it help assures
that the Value Streams and its trains are focused on building the right
things with the appropriate level of investments to these solutions in
order for the portfolio to meet its strategic objectives. In the
small-to-midsize enterprise, one SAFe Portfolio can typically govern the
entire technical solution set. In larger enterprises—usually those with
more than 500 to 1,000 technical practitioners—there can be multiple
SAFe portfolios, typically one for each line of business, or as
otherwise structured around the business organization and funding model.

  - Highest level of interest/ concern /involvement/ in SAFe is **SAFe
    Portfolio**
  - The portfolio provides the basic blocks for organizing the
    Lean-Agile Enterprise flow of value via one or more Value Streams.
  - The portfolio helps to develop systems and solutions which are
    described in strategic themes (links a SAFe portfolio to the
    changing business strategy of an enterprise).
  - To meet strategic objectives, portfolio level encapsulates these
    elements. It provides basic budgeting and other governance
    mechanisms. This way it assures that the investment in the value
    streams provides the returns necessary for the enterprise.
  - A portfolio is connected to business bi-directionally:
      - In order to guide the Portfolio to the larger changing business
        objectives, it provides strategic themes.
      - Another direction indicates the constant flow of portfolio
        values.
  - Program Portfolio Management acts as stakeholders, and they are
    accountable to deliver the business results.
  - SAFe Portfolio Level contains people, processes and necessary build
    systems and solutions that an enterprise needs to meet its strategic
    objectives.
  - Value Streams are the primary objectives in Portfolio, with which
    funding for the people and other resources required to build the
    Solutions.
  - Important key concepts used here are:
      - Connection to the Enterprise,
      - Program Portfolio Management,
      - Managing the Flow of Portfolio Epics.

Working with Portfolio Backlog

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1093104272" class="expand-content">

Everything begins much earlier than the actual planning. In order to
work productively on the Commitment during the planning, you have to
have something to commit for. To ensure this, I have to “load” business
owners with work on probable initiatives (or, in SAFe terminology,
Epics, but hereinafter I’m going to use our usual term) as early as
possible. Ideally, this process should be completely divorced from the
iterative nature of quarterly planning and go its own Kanban way. We
took SAFe Portfolio Kanban as a basis:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/_p/qb/kj/_pqbkjcztxxv5drjbiubf8bkmgk.png)

  
We have a separate JIRA project with three issue types: Epics, Business
Initiatives and Architectural Initiatives; as well as the corresponding
Kanban Board. The algorithm for the Initiative’s Business Owner is
simple: he adds an issue to this project, and it goes to Backlog by
default, which is the first status of our Kanban flow — **Funnel:**

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/nd/ha/f3/ndhaf3kb3ujmxj29j0qs6xpjzkc.png)

Here the Initiatives not yet ready for Review are stored. The Business
Owner works on the content of the Initiative until he feels ready for
the next step. The minimum required at this stage is to have filled-in
fields of Problem Statement, Desired Outcome and Measure of Success, as
well as a slightly more detailed, but simple and clear presentation. At
this stage it is important to leave aside technical solutions and focus
on business parameters. When all data is collected, Business Owner moves
the task to the next status — **Reviewing.**  
  
We conduct Reviews on a weekly basis for both Business and Architectural
Initiatives. Ideally this is a five-minute presentation with subsequent
Q\&As. As a result of the Review a decision is taken about what happens
to the Initiative next. It can:

  - be returned to Funnel for revision,
  - be abolished without a chance for further life (in this case I use a
    special **Out-of-Date** status hidden on the Kanban Board),
  - be approved and moved to the next stage — **Analyzing.**

At this stage we — Yippee\!\!\! — can finally engage IT guys: analysts,
architects, leads, anyone. By “we” I mean myself as a Release Train
Engineer. But ideally it should also be Business Owners, who have
already gained some experience and autonomy necessary for engaging the
right teams and independently launching analytics. Again, I am writing
about the ideal case here. In fact the level of self-organization of our
colleagues is floating, and in some cases they ask for help of a
specially appointed facilitator, but I try to step back from this
practice.  
  
The purpose of this stage is preliminary analytics, or, as we call it,
Pre-discovery. As a result we should get a minimum that would allow us
to commit: proposed solutions, risks and dependencies, non-functional
and infrastructure requirements, user maps, architectural schemes. In
addition, we ask the teams to give a preliminary estimation in story
points at the feature level — this will allow us to determine priorities
at the end of the quarter.  
  
A personal Kanban Board is created at this stage for each Initiative, in
which features and stories can be seen, with a preliminary link to a
specific iteration, which is provided by a separate JIRA workflow. So by
changing the status we can assign the issue to some iteration. Swimlanes
in Kanban Boards are configured by development teams. Since our JIRA
ecosystem is rather complicated, during Pre-discovery and Discovery we
create tasks in separate projects in order not to litter the Teams’
backlogs:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/ug/sq/be/ugsqbekca0gmm_r3qy6q4rl1_sc.png)

  
Also at the Pre-discovery stage, we involve Architects or, as it’s been
often practiced lately, their trusted people — “EA Ambassadors”. Their
task is to convey the vision of the architectural department to all the
participants, to help find the best solution, and finally to approve
this solution with the company's Head of Enterprise Architecture.  
When all the people involved believe that the Initiative has been
analyzed enough and is ready for the next step, it is moved to the next
status — **Portfolio Backlog.**  
At this stage it is important to conduct a WSJF prioritization (
[Weighted Shortest Job
First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_job_next#Weighted_shortest_job_first)
). To do this, we have a big meeting 3 weeks before the planning, which,
unfortunately, up to now has always lasted many hours. During this
meeting members of the Management Board evaluate the Business Value,
Time Criticality, Risk Reduction and Opportunity Enablement with the
help of Fibonacci-aligned planning poker:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/oa/uu/tf/oauutfrn4oy4gmj_iex_mzcgrno.png)

  
To be able to track the history of Initiatives, for each of them I add a
label in JIRA with quarter data: 2018Q4, 2019Q1, etc.  
Looking ahead, let me describe all the possible statuses. After the
final commitment at PI Planning, Initiatives successfully taken into
work are moved to the **Implementing** status, while those ‘not fitted’
receive **Parked** status and might be considered for the next quarters.
Delivered initiatives are moved to the **Done** status.  
As a result, we have the following picture on the Kanban Board:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/jj/ww/ov/jjwwovbdgbyuddjwmnv9fzb3gza.png)

  
Of course, we are not even in the middle of our way yet, but at the
moment I can already note that thanks to the Portfolio Backlog
implementationBusiness owners have begun to work through their
Initiatives in detail and thoroughly prepare for the Review.

  - The Reviews have become more meticulous in a good way.
  - Teams have more time for Pre-discovery.
  - I do not lose old Initiatives — I can always go back to the Parked,
    not delivered or forgotten Initiatives and work on them further.

### Tools used at this stage:

  - Atlassian Jira Software Server
  - Plugin Colors for Jira — for highlighting Business and Architectural
    Initiatives
  - The ‘ *Structure — Project Management at Scale*’ plugin — to
    visualize the structure made of Initiatives and features belonging
    to them, and their WSJF prioritization
  - Atlassian Confluence — source of internal documentation
  - Lucidchart and its plugins for Jira and Confluence — for diagrams
    drawing

Preparation for PI Planning

</div>

<div id="expander-content-892861359" class="expand-content">

A month before PI Planning is when the busiest time comes. Too many
things need to be taken into account, and in order not to leave anything
out, I have to create a multipage “logistic” Google Form. Let me
describe the most important tabs from this Form and the activities
around them.  
**Feedback.** A few days after each PI Planning we conduct a
Retrospective, which helps us not to forget what conclusions we came to
and how we need to adjust the course. This is an important part in terms
of continuous improvement.  
**Technical preparation.** With transition to remote planning, specific
requests have appeared, such as quality of Internet connection
(prioritization and optimization of routes for JIRA and Confluence) and
video- and audio presence (we use the Logitec Group kits, Jabbra
microphones and personal headphones in various combinations, webcams,
Zoom software for video conferencing).  
**Facilitators.** It’s a list of employees responsible for facilitation
in each of the working groups, indicating their location and a link to
the permanent Zoom-channel of the working group.  
**Audience.** The complete list of all invitees.  
**Checklist.** The full list of important tasks with deadlines and
responsible persons. To give you some insight below you can find several
examples of the most typical and vital tasks relevant for each PI
Planning: training of Facilitators (a training manual has been prepared
with all the necessary steps such as organizing a working team, timing
the meetings and decomposing the Initiative into a list of features);
update of working groups’ location plans for each office; control of the
Velocity update for all development teams; ordering meals; creating
reports from previous quarters; printouts of lists of Initiatives and
schedules.

PI Planning and the process of Commitment

</div>

<div id="expander-content-17084812" class="expand-content">

After all the preparatory running around, this moment finally comes —
the start of PI Planning. In two days we have to discover all
Initiatives, make sure that the information is sufficient and commit.
After a few pep talks the working groups go to their places and get to
business. At the moment the number of groups is distributed among the
three offices as 4x4x2, and remote users are connected to the required
group via a dedicated Zoom channel.  
Upon completion of the Discovery on each of these Initiatives, the
facilitator makes sure that all the necessary data, such as Acceptance
Criteria, technical solution, risks, dependencies, the necessity of a
new infrastructure, is available and marks the Initiative with the ‘IT
Session Finished’ checkbox for easy tracking of the progress. After that
the working group can move on to the next Initiative.  
After a dozen of PI Plannings the feeling of being under constant stress
and time pressure, which was with us from the very beginning, has
significantly faded, and now it’s all more like work as usual. In the
afternoon on the first and second days of the Planning it’s the time for
unhurried commitment according to priorities. To perform a commitment, I
have several separate structures. The first one is a structure
containing a list of features and stories scheduled for the commitment:

  
![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/jw/b9/du/jwb9dufutnxjl0cceuedtqdigcc.png)

  
Unfortunately, this structure on the screenshot contains only tasks that
did not fit into the commitment of the current quarter, so the sample is
unrepresentative. In any case, in the search field I can select the
Initiative needed in order of priority by number, which is put in a
separate field for each feature and story, change the issues’ status
from Planned to Committed and put them to the desired iteration, thereby
committing for them:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/ux/i5/hs/uxi5hsw4ahbf4vqtvse03x0z2mc.png)

As a result, the issue will disappear from this structure and appear in
a new, which reflects the growing commitment:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/6q/qh/af/6qqhaf8c7gsne22kaw78jfaw9xe.png)

As you can see on the screenshot, in this structure the stories fall
into the folder of the development team to which they belong and are
grouped by iteration. Here, I see the total Velocity of the team in the
folder name, and in addition in the Commitment column, the over
commitment is automatically determined and highlighted for each team, by
using a custom formula.  
Of course, if the first and highest priority Initiatives are included
into a commitment mostly easily, soon, as more and more teams fill their
backlogs to the end, there could be respective problems with some of the
initiatives, after certain arguments and discussions, being postponed
(parked) as a result.  
At the end of this rather straightforward process the teams swear to
deliver their commitment on the company's flag (ok, not really) and
hurry to their homes (well, again, not really, mostly they flee to some
bar to celebrate).

#### Tools used at this stage:

  - Atlassian Jira Software Server
  - The ‘Structure — Project Management at Scale’ plugin – to monitor
    the Discovery process and during the execution of the commitment.

Cloning issues into the working JIRA ecosystem of the Company

</div>

<div id="expander-content-368758023" class="expand-content">

While everyone is drinking, the RTE is working on creating commitments
in the form in which it could be distributed to the development teams’
backlogs and monitored throughout the quarter. To do this, I use the
'Bulk Clone Professional for Jira' plugin — it adds an item doing
collective cloning to the Bulk Change menu and has such necessary
features as links cloning, updating links between newly created clones,
updating Epic links, adding Summary prefix and automatic labeling:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/pp/5u/j7/pp5uj7lre2_7zsogsv7mgp_d2fw.png)

  
I add status as a prefix, because at the planning stage the statuses
reflect the planned iteration of completion. As a result I can see right
away in the Summary when we are planning to finish the feature or
story.  
At first, I clone absolutely all issues into a separate Global Backlog
project, since we keep epics in it, and I need to have actual epic-story
connections in newly cloned tasks. And already as a second step, I make
JQL-requests for each development team separately and move the stories
into the working projects of the teams.  
As a result, I create a structure that reflects the current Commitment
and consists of final stories, which I then use for monitoring:

![](https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/9y/xa/ep/9yxaeplzfj05z1sgqydu8w4j4dy.png)

In general, the advantages of this approach are the following:

  - It is easier for an IT guy to type new features and stories rather
    than to write them down with a highlighter on a sticky note.
  - Many things, such as capacity remains and WSJF update depending on
    the stories estimations, are calculated automatically using custom
    formulas.
  - Thanks to cloning, the original Commitment is preserved for history
    and we can always return to it.
  - It saves us both time and energy at the stage of planning
    preparation — paper handling takes energy.
  - Of course, it's great that we no longer need to add issues to JIRA
    by typing in sticky notes.

### Tools used at this stage:

  - Atlassian Jira Software Server
  - The ‘ *Bulk Clone Professional for Jira*’ Plugin– for cloning
    features and stories into working JIRA projects.
  - The ‘ *Structure — Project Management at Scale*’ plugin – for the
    creation of the final Commitment structure.

Program Levels

<div id="expander-content-878604611" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

The Program Level contains the roles and activities needed to
continuously deliver solutions via an Agile Release Train (ART).
The program level is where development teams, stakeholders, and other
resources are devoted to some important, ongoing system
development mission. The ART metaphor describes the program level
teams, roles, and activities that incrementally deliver a continuous
flow of value. ARTs are virtual organizations formed to span functional
boundaries, eliminate unnecessary handoffs and steps, and accelerate
value delivery by implementing SAFe Lean-Agile principles and practices.
Although it is called the program level, ARTs are long-lived and,
therefore, have a more persistent self-organization, structure, and
mission than traditional programs which usually have definitive start
and end dates, as well as temporarily assigned resources. The ARTs
operating at the Program Level are ultimately responsible for creating
and releasing value in flow at the frequency needed by the enterprise to
meet market and customer demand. The mindsets and practices in this
level contribute to the enterprise competency of DevOps and Release on
Demand that makes this flow of value possible.

  - In Program level, Value of SAFe is delivered by long-lived Agile
    Release Trains (ART). Iteration is for team and train is for the
    program.
  - Agile Release Trains (ART) is the primary vehicle for value delivery
    at the program level. It delivers a value stream to the
    organization.
  - The Program Increments (PIs) duration is of 8 to 12 weeks.
  - ART is of 5 - 12 Agile Teams (\~50 – 125+ people) which includes all
    the roles and infrastructure needed to deliver fully tested,
    working, system-level software.
  - Each PI is a multiple-Iteration time box. During which a
    significant, valuable increment of the system is developed and
    delivered.
  - In each PI a "demo" and "Inspect and adapt" sessions will happen,
    and Planning begins for the next PSI.
  - At the Program level, SAFe emphasis on the principle of alignment.
    This is because multiple agile team efforts are integrated to create
    customer value.
  - SAFe artifact hierarchy is **Epics-\>features-\>user stories**.
  - At a Program level, Product Manager/Program Manager has content
    authority. He defines and prioritizes the program backlog.
  - Program backlog is a prioritized list of features.
  - At the program level, features can be originated, or they can derive
    from epics defined at the portfolio level.
  - Features decompose to user stories and flow into team-level
    backlogs.
  - Product Manager or the Release Train Engineer role could be handled
    by the Program Manager/Senior Project Manager
  - System Architect role at the program level is to collaborate day to
    day work with the teams. It ensures that non-functional requirements
    are met. Also, they work with the enterprise architect at the
    portfolio level to make sure there is sufficient architectural
    runway to support upcoming user and business needs.
  - Interface design, user experience guidelines and design elements for
    the teams are provided by UX Designers.
  - Chief-Scrum Master role is played by 'Release Train Engineer'.
  - Various team (from marketing, development, quality, operations, and
    deployment) forms 'Release Management Team'. They will approve
    routine releases of quality solutions to customers.
  - Deployment of software into customer environments and successful
    delivery is taken care of by DevOps team.

The Team Level contains the roles, activities, events, and processes
which Agile Teams build and deliver value in the context of the Agile
Release Train (ART). Teams are the foundation of SAFe and the Lean
enterprise, as they perform the clear majority of the work that delivers
customer value. SAFe’s Team Level describes how to create
high-performing teams that create high-quality components and solutions,
supporting both team agility and technical agility. While depicted
somewhat separately in the ‘Big Picture,’ the SAFe team level is a vital
part of the Program Level. All SAFe teams are part of an ART—the primary
construct of the program level.

Each agile team is responsible for defining, building, and testing
Stories from their Team Backlog. Using common Iteration cadence and
synchronization, the teams align to a series of fixed-length Iterations
to make sure the entire system is iterating. Teams use ScrumXP or Kanban
to deliver high-quality systems, routinely producing a System Demo every
two weeks. This ensures that all teams in the ART create an integrated
and tested system that stakeholders can evaluate and respond to with
fast feedback.

  - Teams also support the System Demo at the end of each Iteration.
    which is the critical integration point for the ART.
  - Larger Value Streams will have multiple ARTs.
  - The Innovation and Planning (IP) Iterations leverage the teams with
    an opportunity for innovation and exploration.

Value Stream Level

</div>

<div id="expander-content-40416418" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

Value Streams represent the series of steps that an organization uses to
build Solutions that provide a continuous flow of value to a customer. A
SAFe portfolio consists of a set of development value streams, each of
which builds and supports one or more solutions. The primary role of a
SAFe portfolio is to fund and nurture a set of development value
streams. These value streams either deliver end-user value directly or
support internal business processes. Organizing around value streams
offers substantial benefits to the organization, including faster
learning, shorter time-to-market, higher quality, higher productivity,
and leaner budgeting mechanisms.  In SAFe, organizing around value is
accomplished by first understanding value streams and then launching
Agile Release Trains or Solution Trains to fulfill them. Realizing value
streams via trains is the ‘art’ and science of SAFe. Furthermore, value
stream mapping can be used to identify and address delays and
non-value-added activities to accomplish the Lean-Agile goal of the
shortest sustainable lead time.

Severity vs. Priority

</div>

<div id="expander-content-2061097211" class="expand-content">

Author:  [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

## Severity

Severity is defined as the degree of impact a
[Defect](https://www.guru99.com/the-unconventional-guide-to-defect-management.html)
has on the development or operation of a component application being
tested.

Higher effect on the system functionality will lead to the assignment of
higher severity to the bug. [Quality
Assurance](https://www.guru99.com/all-about-quality-assurance.html)
engineer usually determines the severity level of defect

## Priority

Priority is defined as the order in which a defect should be fixed.
Higher the priority the sooner the defect should be resolved.

Defects that leave the software system unusable are given higher
priority over defects that cause a small functionality of the software
to fail.

## Defect Severity and Priority Types

*In Software Testing, Defect severity can be categorized into four
class*

  - **Critical**: This defect indicates complete shut-down of the
    process, nothing can proceed further
  - **Major**: It is a highly severe defect and collapses the system.
    However, certain parts of the system remain functional
  - **Medium**: It causes some undesirable behavior, but the system is
    still functional
  - **Low**: It won't cause any major break-down of the system

*Defect priority can be categorized into three class*

  - **Low:** The Defect is an irritant but repair can be done once the
    more serious Defect has been fixed
  - **Medium:** During the normal course of the development activities
    defect should be resolved. It can wait until a new version is
    created
  - **High:** The defect must be resolved as soon as possible as it
    affects the system severely and cannot be used until it is fixed

## Tips for determining the Severity of a Defect

  - **Decide the frequency of occurrence:** In some cases, if the
    occurrence of a minor-defect is frequent in the code, it can be more
    severe. So from a user's perspective, it is more serious even though
    it is a minor defect.
  - **Isolate the defect:** Isolating the defect can help to find out
    its severity of the impact.

Example of Defect Severity and Priority

![](https://www.guru99.com/images/5-2015/050115_0552_PriorityVsS2.png)

Let see an example of low severity and high priority and vice versa

  - **A very low severity with a high priority:** A logo error for any
    shipment website, can be of low severity as it not going to affect
    the functionality of the website but can be of high priority as you
    don't want any further shipment to proceed with the wrong logo.

  - **A very high severity with a low priority:** Likewise, for flight
    operating website, a defect in reservation functionality may be of
    high severity but can be a low priority as it can be scheduled to
    release in a next cycle.

## Defect Triage

Defect triage is a process that tries to do the re-balancing of the
process where the test team faces the problem of limited availability of
resources. So, when there are large number of the defect and limited
testers to verify them, defect triage helps to try to get as many
defects resolved based on defect parameters like severity and priority.

### How to determine Defect Triage

![](https://www.guru99.com/images/5-2015/050115_0552_PriorityVsS3.png)

Most systems use priority as the main criteria to assess the defect.
However, a good triage process considers the severity as well.

The triage process includes the following steps

  - Reviewing all the defects including rejected defects by the team
  - Initial assessment of the defects is based on its content and
    respective priority and severity settings
  - Prioritizing the defect based on the inputs
  - Assign the defect to correct release by product manager
  - Re-directs the defect to the correct owner/team for further action

## Guidelines that every tester should consider before selecting a severity

Severity parameter is assessed by the tester whereas the priority
parameter is assessed by the product manager or by the triage team. For
prioritizing the defect, it is imperative for a tester to choose the
right severity to avoid confusion with the development team.

  - Understand the concept of priority and severity well
  - Always assign the severity level based on the issue type as this
    will affect its priority
  - Understand how a particular scenario or [Test
    Case](https://www.guru99.com/test-case.html) would affect the
    end-user
  - Need to consider how much time it would take to fix the defect based
    on its complexity and time to verify the defect

**Functional Testing**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

Functional testing is a type of software testing whereby the system
is tested against the functional requirements/specifications. Functions
(or features) are tested by feeding them input and examining the
output. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly
satisfied by the application. The two most common (and mostly used at
Pinnacle) are Scripted testing and Exploratory testing.

Functional Testing is defined as a type of testing which verifies that
each  **function** of the software application operates in conformance
with the requirement specification. This testing mainly involves black
box testing and it is not concerned about the source code of the
application.

Each and every functionality of the system is tested by providing
appropriate input, verifying the output and comparing the actual results
with the expected results.

This testing involves checking of User Interface, APIs, Database,
security, client/ server applications and functionality of the
Application Under Test. The testing can be done either manually or using
automation

Beta / Acceptance Testing

</div>

<div id="expander-content-353547078" class="expand-content">

An  [acceptance
test](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-acceptance-testing/)
 is performed by the client and verifies whether the end to end the
flow of the system is as per the business requirements or not and if it
is as per the needs of the end user. Client accepts the software only
when all the features and functionalities work as expected.

It is the last phase of the testing, after which the software goes into
production. This is also called User Acceptance Testing (UAT) / Staging
environment.

Acceptance testing is a formal type of software testing that is
performed by end user when the features have been delivered by
developers. The aim of this testing is to check if the software confirms
to their business needs and to the requirements provided earlier.
Acceptance tests are normally documented at the beginning of the sprint
(in agile) and is a means for testers and developers to work towards a
common understanding and shared business domain knowledge.

This is a formal type of software testing that is carried out by end
customers before releasing or handing over software to end users.
Successful completion of Beta testing means customer acceptance of the
software.

[Beta Testing](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/beta-testing/)  is a
formal type of software testing which is carried out by the customer. It
is performed in  **the Real Environment **before releasing the product
to the market for the actual end users.

Beta testing is carried out to ensure that there are no major failures
in the software or product and it satisfies the business requirements
from an end-user perspective. Beta testing is successful when the
customer accepts the software.

Usually, this testing is typically done by end-users or others. It is
the final testing done before releasing an application for commercial
purpose. Usually, the Beta version of the software or product released
is limited to a certain number of users in a specific area.

So end user actually uses the software and shares the feedback to the
company. Company then takes necessary action before releasing the
software to the worldwide.

Exploratory Testing

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1317487276" class="expand-content">

Exploratory Testing is informal testing performed by the testing team.
The objective of this testing is to explore the application and looking
for defects that exist in the application. Sometimes it may happen that
during this testing major defect discovered can even cause system
failure.

During exploratory testing, it is advisable to keep a track of what flow
you have tested and what activity you did before the start of the
specific flow.

[An exploratory testing
technique](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-exploratory-testing/)
 is performed without documentation and test cases.

In ET, the tester is designing his or her tests and executing them at
the same time. Which is simultaneous learning, test design and test
execution. As an exploratory tester, the next test is influenced by your
previous actions, your observations of the product's behavior, and your
own thought process.  
ET also assumes that a significant portion of the testing will be spent
learning about the product. As you explore, you become more aware of how
the product functions and its expected behavior. You can use that
knowledge to design new and better tests. It also helps improve the
analysis of the test's results.

## Why Do Exploratory Testing?

  
Executing scripted tests over and over will generally produce the same
results. Exploratory testers use their cognitive abilities to
continually improve the value of their work. They explore and adapt,
they learn and adjust. ET is designed to make the most of our
intellectual abilities.  
ET also takes advantage of the differences between testers. Each
tester's previous experience, skills, and thought process (among other
things) causes him or her to view thing in a unique way. Different
testers may come up with different ways to test the same function. It
may be more beneficial to have three testers test the same function in
three unique ways than it is to have all three test it in exactly same
way.  
When a tester is tasked to find bugs quickly, they need to be searching
for bugs, not reading test cases. They need the freedom to follow
promising leads, not the constraints of predefined instructions.

How Do I Get Started?  
If there is one thing all new testers (including new exploratory
testers) should do, it's to start by thinking about the product in
general terms; try to see the big picture. Instead of initially focusing
on one specific thing, first try to understand the context in which you
are working.  
Some questions to consider are:

  - Is this a product in development or is it already in production?
  - What is the purpose of the product?
  - Who are the users and how are they going to use it?

  
Jumping right in and banging on things might produce a bug or two, but
if you hope to get the most out of ET, initial preparation and
understanding your context is vital.  
An exploratory tester would do something like this:

  - Get a notebook (or a digital word processor) to take notes as you
    go.
  - Explore the app as if you just downloaded it and want to use it
    yourself. If it is not an app you would typically use, then imagine
    you are the target market for the app.
  - Take a moment to really get in the mindset of a typical user. Some
    questions you can ask yourself are what is the goal of this app? Who
    would benefit from that? How do they benefit?

  
  
Once you get a feel for the app start going back to the areas that
interested you and you thought might be a place of vulnerability in the
app. This knowledge about vulnerability is going to come with
experience. Don't worry if you don't have any experience yet because you
are about to get some\!  
One by one, work through each area you've earlier identified, exploring
every function in that area. Think of what a real user might do. Come up
with with some use cases or scenarios and execute those. Then think of
variations and execute those. Use the results of your tests to help you
come up with new ideas.  
Focus on one bug at a time, but always be on the lookout for hints of
other bugs or suspicious areas. In your notebook, quickly make a note of
these areas and how to get back to them. This way you can come back and
explore each one later. You could very well end up with 4 or 5 bugs just
from investigating the initial bug.  
Once you've exhausted that area or function of the app, move on to your
next point of interest. As you repeat this process, remember what you've
learned so far and use that information to influence your tests.

Interface Testing

</div>

<div id="expander-content-190640832" class="expand-content">

Interface Testing is needed when a software provides support for one or
more interfaces like “Graphical user interface”, “Command Line
Interface” or “Application programming interface” to interact with its
users or other software. Interfaces serve as the medium for software to
accept input from a user and provide an output to the user. Approach for
interface testing depends on the type of the interface being testing
like GUI or API or CLI.

Testing of all integrated modules to verify the combined functionality
after integration is  [termed as Integration
Testing](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-integration-testing/)
. Modules are typically code modules, individual applications, client
and server applications on a network, etc. This type of testing is
especially relevant to client/server and distributed systems.

Integration testing is one of the most common and important types of
software testing. Once the individual units or components are tested by
developers as working then testing team will run tests that will test
the connectivity among these units/component or multiple
units/components. There are different approaches for Integration testing
namely, Top-down integration testing, Bottom-up integration testing and
a combination of these two known as Sand witch testing.

Different performance and load tools are used to do this testing.

Is a type of software testing and part of performance engineering that
is performed to check some of the quality attributes of software like
Stability, reliability, availability. Performance testing is carried out
by performance engineering team. Unlike Functional testing, Performance
testing is done to check non-functional requirements. Performance
testing checks how well the software works in anticipated and peak
workloads. There are different variations or sub types of performance
like load testing, stress testing, volume testing, soak testing and

is crashing for the initial use then the system is not stable enough for
further testing. Hence a build or an application is assigned to fix it.

Is a type of testing that is carried out mostly by testers and in some
projects by developers as well. Sanity testing is a quick evaluation of
the software, environment, network, external systems are up & running,
software environment as a whole is stable enough to proceed with
extensive testing. Sanity tests are narrow and most of the time sanity

Scripted Testing (ST) is a two-step approach to testing. First the tests
are written; they are planned, designed and documented. Second, the
tests are executed. These two activities are done independently of each
other and in many cases, the person who writes the tests is different
than the person who executes them.

Generally, the tester executing the tests has some knowledge of the
product, or the tests include the information needed to execute them
(requirements). This is important because without that knowledge or
information, the tester might not be able to execute the test or
interpret its results.

 checks that no show stopper defect exists in the build which will
prevent the testing team to test the application in detail.

If testers find that the major critical functionality is broken down at
the initial stage itself then testing team can reject the build and
inform accordingly to the development team. Smoke Testing is carried out
to a detailed level of any functional or regression testing.

Is a type of testing that is carried out by software testers to check if
the new build provided by the development team is stable enough i.e.,
major functionality is working as expected in order to carry out further
or detailed testing. Smoke testing is intended to find “show stopper”
defects that can prevent testers from testing the application in detail.
Smoke testing carried out for a build is also known as build

**Non-Functional Testing**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

Non-functional testing is defined as a type of Software testing to check
non-functional aspects (performance, usability, reliability, etc) of a
software application. It is designed to test the readiness of a system
as per nonfunctional parameters which are never addressed by functional
testing.

## Objectives of Non-functional testing

  - Non-functional testing should increase usability, efficiency,
    maintainability, and portability of the product.
  - Helps to reduce production risk and cost associated with
    non-functional aspects of the product.
  - Optimize the way product is installed, setup, executes, managed and
    monitored.
  - Collect and produce measurements, and metrics for internal research
    and development.
  - Improve and enhance knowledge of the product behavior and
    technologies in use.

## Characteristics of Non-functional testing

  - Non-functional testing should be measurable, so there is no place
    for subjective characterization like good, better, best, etc.
  - Exact numbers are unlikely to be known at the start of the
    requirement process
  - Important to prioritize the requirements
  - Ensure that quality attributes are identified correctly in Software
    Engineering.

Accessibility Testing

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1613929252" class="expand-content">

Accessibility testing, a subset of usability testing, involves
performing tests via software to ensure people with disabilities are
able to use a website without experiencing any sort of barriers.
Essentially, accessibility testing is the process that must take place
prior to addressing accessibility issues on any given website. This is
necessary to ensure you’re meeting the [WCAG
guidelines](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/the-wcag-accessibility-regulations-you-need-to-know).

For nearly any website, a combination of manual and automated
accessibility testing should take place as early as possible during the
design and development phase, as well as often throughout design and
development.

## Why Perform Accessibility Testing?

Products, including websites, should be delivered to people of all
types, including people with disabilities, to ensure inclusivity. For
those with disabilities, assistive technologies are available to help
them better leverage the internet. However, websites must be designed
with these assistive technologies in mind—from screen magnification
software to screen readers to speech recognition software and everything
in between.

Accessibility testing helps to ensure websites are user-friendly and
accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities who rely on
assistive technologies. Ultimately, accessibility testing will ensure
usability for all disabilities, including visual, auditory, speech,
cognitive, and more, as well as usability for individuals who do not
have a disability but can still benefit from websites being easier to
read and navigate.

So why, aside from being inclusive, should you make sure your website is
accessible through accessibility testing?

### Boost Visibility to a Greater Market

Chances are, your product and/or service would be of interest for
persons with disabilities. Think about how much of the population has a
disability of some sort. You don’t want to eliminate such a large
portion of the population from becoming a potential customer.

### Lower Site Development and/or Maintenance Costs

If you make your website accessible from the beginning, you’ll spend
much less money on development and/or maintenance in the long-run. It’s
also much quicker to make changes as needed to a website that’s already
accessible from the start. After all, compliance with applicable
standards and guidelines will be mandatory eventually.

### Improve Usability on Different Browsers and/or Devices

Websites that are accessible will operate better on a variety of
browsers and/or devices than those that aren’t accessible. They will
work better for those in situationally challenging circumstances as
well, such as noisy airports or natural lighting that causes glare.

## Common Disabilities

A disability is any condition of the mind or body that makes it
difficult for the individual to perform certain activities or interact
with society and/or the world around them. Disabilities are known for
resulting in limitations in terms of participation and activity. There
are many different types of disabilities, including but not limited to:

### 1\. Cognitive

Cognitive disabilities are the most common form of disability an
individual can experience. They often result from conditions present at
birth or conditions developed at some point in life, such as chemical
imbalances, infections, traumatic injuries, and more. There are
approximately 16 million people impacted by a cognitive disability in
the United States, although two people with the same cognitive
disability may experience entirely separate challenges.

Most individuals with a cognitive disability will require assistance, to
some degree, to help them approach their day-to-day lives. Cognitive
disabilities are classified in two ways: clinical and functional. The
clinical category includes Down syndrome, autism, dementia, and
traumatic brain injuries, as well as various other less severe
conditions. The functional category, on the other hand, focuses on the
individual’s abilities and challenges resulting from the disability,
such as:

  - Memory
  - Problem-solving
  - Reading/verbal comprehension
  - Attention
  - Math comprehension
  - Visual comprehension

The functional category is particularly helpful to be aware of when
developing websites. This allows us to review the types of barriers
those with cognitive disabilities face—helping to ensure websites
address those barriers in all technical and navigational aspects.

### 2\. Blindness

Blindness is characterized as sightlessness or loss of vision. When we
speak of blindness, we generally are referring to a total loss of
vision, whereas partial blindness refers to low vision. Blindness has
several potential causes, including but not limited to the following:

  - Glaucoma
  - Stroke
  - Diabetes
  - Macular degeneration
  - Accidents or injuries to the eye
  - Retinitis Pigmentosa

Approximately 285 million people are visually impaired to some degree
worldwide. Of those 285 million people, 39 million are completely blind.
Those who are blind use the internet with a range of assistive
technologies, such as screen readers, braille devices, and keyboards.

When web developers don’t consider blindness while developing websites,
those who are blind aren’t able to use those websites unless they’re
gathering information from someone else.

### 3\. Vision Disabilities

Vision disabilities, also known as visual impairment, refers to a
decreased ability to see that cannot be solved with medication or
glasses. Visual impairment can result from trauma, disease, as well as
degenerative or congenital conditions. Some eye disorders leading to
visual impairment include:

  - Glaucoma
  - Cataracts
  - Retinal degeneration
  - Albinism
  - Muscular problems
  - Infection
  - Diabetic retinopathy
  - And more

In addition, visual impairment can result from brain and nerve
disorders. When this happens, it’s known as cortical visual impairment.
As mentioned above, there are approximately 285 million people with
visual impairment worldwide. Of those individuals, 246 million have low
vision as opposed to being completely blind.

Similar to blindness, web developers must consider those with visual
impairment as they often use various assistive technologies to access
the web. Websites must be made accessible and able to support those
assistive technologies.

### 4\. Deafblindness

Deafblindness refers to having little or no sight and hearing. Those who
are deafblind may experience varying degrees of sight and hearing
impairment. A person may be deaf or blind at birth and lose the other
sense at some point throughout life. A person who is born deaf/blind has
congenital deafblindness, while a person who loses one or both of the
senses at some point in life has acquired deafblindness.

Helen Keller is a very well-known example of someone who had
deafblindness. There are approximately 35,000 – 40,000 individuals who
are medically deafblind in the United States. Congenital deafblindness
can be caused by the following:

  - Genetic conditions from birth, such as trisomy 13
  - Illness or infection, such as AIDs or rubella
  - Pregnancy-related problems, such as fetal alcohol syndrome
  - Complications related to prematurity

Those who end up with deafblindness at some point in life usually
acquire it due to a variety of reasons:

  - Genetic conditions, such as usher syndrome
  - Meningitis
  - Illness
  - Age-related loss of sight and/or sound
  - Physical damage
  - Stroke
  - Brain damage

Those who are deafblind rely on various assistive technologies, such as
braille displays or screen readers, to leverage the internet in
life-changing ways. Web developers must consider those with
deafblindness during the design phase of any given website.

### 5\. Physical Impairments

A physical impairment refers to any disability that limits a person’s
ability to remain mobile or active. Essentially, physical impairments
impact functioning, mobility, stamina or dexterity. This can include:

  - Brain or spinal cord injuries
  - Cerebral palsy
  - Multiple sclerosis
  - Respiratory disorders
  - Epilepsy
  - And much more

Physical impairments significantly impact the individual’s ability to
take part in various activities throughout day-to-day living. They
usually fall into one of two main categories:

  - Congenital: The physical impairment occurred due to inherited
    genetic problems or other issues at birth.
  - Acquired: The physical impairment occurred due to an accident,
    disease or infection at some point in life.

Those with physical disabilities make up a large amount of the
population. In fact, approximately 75 million people have some type of
physical disability throughout the United States. Physical disabilities
often include weakness and limitations in terms of muscular control.
This means web developers must consider any design and/or functionality
aspects that would be impossible with involuntary movements, tremors or
lack of coordination.

## How to Do Accessibility Testing

The web is an incredibly important resource for everyone, including
people with disabilities. It makes many aspects of life—from healthcare
to recreation to employment—much easier than they would be without the
web. The benefits of performing accessibility testing are clear, but
where do you start? As web accessibility becomes a more prevalent topic,
training programs are popping up all over the place to help teach
individuals how to create accessible content.

Most training programs focus on the WCAG 2.1 guidelines, which provide
various technical specifications and techniques for web developers to
follow when it comes to creating accessible content. So how do you
perform accessibility testing?

### 1\. Start Learning about Accessibility

The first step to performing accessibility testing is learning how to
create accessible content. After all, you don’t want to go through the
process of testing something that isn’t even close to accessible. This
[article](https://dynomapper.com/blog/27-accessibility-testing/556-where-to-learn-web-accessibility)
about “where to learn web accessibility” is a great start. It reviews
various resources to help web developers and businesses learn more about
web accessibility, many of which are free of charge. Here are a few
resources to consider:

  - **Google’s Introduction to Web Accessibility**

Google offers an introductory guide, as well as practice design labs and
samples for those looking to learn web accessibility. There is no
requirement of prerequisite knowledge, but it is helpful to have some
background in web design. The course teaches what accessibility is,
advanced accessibility techniques, and more important information to
create usable and accessible websites.

  - **International Association of Accessibility Professionals
    Certification (IAAP)**

The IAAP offers a certification program that helps individuals add to
their professional qualifications with proof of capabilities and/or
knowledge of accessibility. The IAAP offers two types of certifications:
a professional level credential and a technical level credential. You
don’t have to be a member of the IAAP to take any certification course,
and prior experience is not necessary but helpful.

  - **Microsoft’s Training Teachers to Author Accessible Content**

Microsoft offers an hour-long course, separated into ten modules, on web
accessibility. A valid Microsoft account is necessary to complete the
course on their website. Each module has course notes and a video
provided to individuals taking the course. You will learn how to create
and revise documents so everyone, including those with disabilities, can
access them.

### 2\. Perform Manual Testing

There are a lot of accessibility issues that might be missed with a
computer program. [Manual
testing](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/manual-accessibility-testing-keyboard-and-screen-reader-navigation) involves
having human testers perform a range of tests to ensure the website is
actually usable for individuals with disabilities. Similar to any type
of editing or quality assurance, you’re able to get an entirely new
viewpoint with each person who performs manual testing. Testers will
look for:

  - Compatibility with various assistive technologies
  - Navigation that is simple and easy to understand
  - Content that is meaningful and clear/concise
  - Coordination with color adjustment plugins for various web browsers
  - And much more

Any testers used should be familiar with the latest standards when it
comes to web accessibility. That means they must understand WCAG 2.1 to
ensure they’re looking for the right factors that matter to people with
disabilities.

### 3\. Perform Automated Testing

Automated testing is the process of using software tools designed to
find accessibility issues. These tools have evolved quite a bit over the
past few years. It’s not difficult to find a range of tools available to
help you adhere to accessibility guidelines. In fact, there are browser
extensions, command-line tools, and much more. These tools should be
used at the beginning of the design process and periodically throughout
to catch issues before they go into production.

## Why Use Manual and Automated Testing?

Manual and automated testing should be used in combination with one
another in order to ensure a thorough testing process that doesn’t miss
anything important. Automated tools are great for finding:

  - Images without alt text
  - Content that doesn’t have headings
  - HTML code that isn’t valid
  - Form fields that are missing labels and/or descriptions
  - And much more

However, as much as technology has advanced, human intervention can help
find issues that no software tool is able to pinpoint, such as:

  - Alt text that isn’t accurate given the context
  - Descriptions that aren’t clear or easy to understand
  - Headings that don’t make sense given the hierarchy
  - And much more

From a usability standpoint, something like a misleading alt tag makes a
world of difference, even though it’s not findable with an automated
tool.

## Automated Accessibility Testing Tools

As mentioned, there’s a wide range of software tools available for
automated testing. The process of testing for accessibility should be
ongoing throughout all stages of development. If you have the means, a
continuous integration solution can be very beneficial. Some common
tools for automated testing include:

### 1\. Dyno Mapper

Dyno Mapper allows you to test entire websites for WCAG 1.0, 2.0,
2.1/Section 508 compliance, as well as various other guidelines:

  - BITV 1.0 (Level 2)
  - Stanca Act

The tool offers various features to ensure you’re able to fix any known
errors in web content and design:

  - **The ability to visualize:** Use a browser to view accessibility
    tests with icons showing over the website image to indicate known,
    likely, and potential issues.
  - **Check public or private applications:** Check public or private
    applications with basic authentication, CMS authentication or custom
    form authentication.
  - **Perform ongoing automatic testing/monitoring:** Use the schedule
    feature to ensure automatic testing and reporting on a monthly
    basis.
  - **Receive notifications when issues arise:** If an issue is found,
    you will receive notifications sent to your email to alert you of
    known, likely, and potential issues.

### 2\. SiteImprove

SiteImprove allows you to ensure your website is inclusive and usable
for every visitor that comes your way. This helps you adhere to various
global accessibility guidelines, including WCAG 2.1, with features such
as:

  - **Accessibility diagnosis:** Use practical recommendations, your own
    criteria or the tool’s scoring system to decide which issues you
    want to fix first.
  - **On-page and in-code highlights:** View issues with on-page and
    in-code highlights that make it simpler than ever to fix errors.
  - **Quality assurance/accessibility dashboards:** See how far you’ve
    come in terms of accessibility with customizable dashboards and
    automated reports.

The tool lets you see every link, page, and media file at a
glance—locating issues that could impact your site’s accessibility
level.

### 3\. Monsido

Monsido scans your website for any issues that may be stopping you from
reaching ADA compliance with Section 508 and WCAG 2.1 standards. You’re
able to leverage this tool to:

  - **Choose the compliance level you need:** Not all sectors have the
    same compliance requirements, so you’re able to check for WCAG 2.1
    or Section 508 accessibility issues.
  - **Leverage a built-in help center:** A help center is available via
    an icon for times when you’re not quite sure how to fix an issue and
    would like some detailed information or instructions.
  - **View your accessibility status:** Compliance standards are
    organized by levels, such as A, AA, and AAA—allowing you to fix
    low-level issues first and foremost before putting time into
    high-level issues.
  - **Reach out for training sessions:** Take advantage of training and
    one-on-one support options available to you and your team to ensure
    you’re up-to-date on the latest best practices.

The tool will scan your domain on a weekly basis to help ensure
compliance at all times. This information can be found in the dashboard
wherein you can see a total count of issues and which pages they’re
found on.

## Accessibility Testing Checklist

When it comes to accessibility testing, it might feel like there’s a lot
of work to do, and while that’s true, a checklist can make the process a
lot easier. Here’s an accessibility testing checklist to follow.

**TEXT**

  - Can users enlarge the text if needed?
  - Is there enough contrast between the text color and the background
    color?
  - Does the website use bold, underlined, and italics when needed?
  - Are the navigation items labeled clearly in a way that’s
    understandable?
  - Is the font easy to read, and if not, can the user override fonts
    for text displays?

**VIDEO AND AUDIO**

  - Do all video and audio clips used fit with the content shown on the
    page?
  - Are subtitles or transcripts available for any form of multimedia
    used?
  - Can video and audio clips be stopped once the page loads?
  - Are video and audio clips dangerous for those sensitive to light and
    sound?
  - Are users able to adjust audio or video controls as needed?

**COLOR AND CONTRAST**

  - Do background and foreground colors have enough contrast?
  - Is color-coding used as a means of conveying information or
    indicating actions?

**IMAGES**

  - Do all images used have a purpose (to convey information)?
  - Is the site loading slowly because of too many images?
  - Do all images have alternate text to go with them?
  - Are there low contrast/extremely bright colors that may be difficult
    to view?
  - Do any images flash, rotate or move without the ability to stop
    them?

**LANGUAGE**

  - Are you using a higher than average vocabulary?
  - Is the language clear and concise without confusing terms?
  - Are there links to explain words that might be advanced?

**FORMS**

  - Are text boxes within forms clearly labeled?
  - Are text boxes organized properly and predictably (name, address,
    city, etc.)?
  - Can forms be filled out using the keyboard to go from one box to the
    next?

**HEADINGS**

  - Are headings simple and descriptive so the meaning is clear to
    users?
  - Is there a linked table of contents on pages with a lot of
    information?

Maintenance Testing is done on the already deployed software. The
deployed software needs to be enhanced, changed or migrated to other
hardware. The Testing done during this enhancement, change and migration
cycle is known as maintenance testing.

Once the software is deployed in operational environment it needs some
maintenance from time to time in order to avoid system breakdown, most
of the banking software systems needs to be operational 24\*7\*365. So
it is very necessary to do maintenance testing of software applications.

In maintenance testing, tester should consider 2 parts.

Any changes made in software should be tested thoroughly.

The changes made in software does not affect the existing functionality
of the software, so regression testing is also done.

Alpha Testing

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1456494105" class="expand-content">

Alpha testing is a type of testing in which users are invited to the
development center where the software is being built.  The developers
note the actions that a user takes during this testing. Any deviation of
the system from normal behavior is noted and the developers rectify all
the issues found within the system.

Alpha testing is carried out just before beta testing and after the
[acceptance
testing](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/ultimate-guide-to-user-acceptance-testing/)
is done.  In-house members of the software company who are not part of
the project team do the alpha testing. These alpha testers are usually
developers and quality assurance team members from other project teams.

![Alpha
Testing](https://reqtest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Alpha-Testing-Basics-big.png)

## Two phases of alpha testing:

**Phase 1**

In the first phase, software engineers do the testing. They use debugger
software to improve the process. The main aim is to find all the bugs as
quickly as possible.

**Phase 2**

Quality assurance team conducts the second phase of this testing. This
phase includes the black box as well as [white box
testing](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/white-box-testing-example/).

The main purpose of doing alpha testing is to discover bugs that escaped
the previous tests. Alpha testing help to detect and fix bugs that exist
in the system just before releasing it for beta testing.

## Advantages

Here are the advantages of doing alpha testing:

  - This testing gives you an insight into the quality of the software
    at an early stage.
  - It helps to uncover bugs that can pose a serious threat.
  - During this testing, the real-time behavior of the users and the
    environment is imitated.
  - It helps to deliver good quality software for [beta
    testing](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/beta-testing-tutorial/).

Beta Testing

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1816839802" class="expand-content">

In Beta Testing, the software is distributed as a beta version to a
limited set of users outside the company. This helps to get the software
tested by end-users in a real environment. These users are called beta
testers; they test the software in a real-world scenario. They provide
feedback to the developers to help them fix any issues before the
software is released to the market.

The beta testers check and validate the functionality, usability,
reliability, security, and compatibility of the software. Beta Testing
helps to ensure there is a lesser number of faults and bugs in the
software. Beta testing helps to increase end-user satisfaction from the
software.

![what is beta
testing](https://reqtest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beta-Testing-Tutorial-big.jpg)

During pre-release, the software is already extensively tested by the QA
team and verified by the [Quality
Analyst](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/qa-analyst/). The testing in a
live environment from the user perspective is still missing. Beta
testing is used for pre-release testing of the software.

Professional testers often fail to test the real user’s interaction with
the software in the testing phase. Real users are different from
professional testers. Users can uncover more bugs and defects in the
software after its release in the market. It is expensive to resolve the
bugs after the release. It is suggested to address the potential error
in the software before the release of the product.

It focuses on pre-release testing to ensure quality and customer
satisfaction of the software.

It helps to check the real-world compatibility of the software as it is
checked on various platforms and for a wide range of devices, OS, and
browsers.

There are specific platforms where the software code breaks as the
platform wasn’t covered in the testing phase. Beta testing helps to fix
and improve the product to be fit and compatible with all possible
platforms.

The problems are identified at the end-user level; the problems that
impact the user experience. Beta testing helps to reduce business risk
due to customer dissatisfaction.

Beta testing is of two types open and closed beta. The products have to
go through these two tests based on numbers of beta users.

**Open beta:** This beta testing has a large group of people and
interested individuals as beta testers. They report bugs and also
provide feedback and suggestion on additional features that software
should include in the released version.

**Closed beta:** This beta testing has a selected group of people on an
invitation-only basis as beta testers.

## How to develop a Beta Testing strategy?

The beta testing strategy must include:

  - The business objectives of the software
  - The schedule for the entire phases of beta testing, cycles, duration
    of each cycle.
  - Test Plan
  - Testing approach to be followed by participants
  - Use of tools to measure productivity, feedback, & rating
  - Rewards and incentives to the participants
  - How to end the beta testing phase

## How to write a Beta Test Plan?

A beta test plan can be created in various ways based on the depth of
the testing product.

The test plan contains the following attributes:

**Objective**: It defines the objective of the project to help beta
testers understand the outcome and the reason for beta testing even
after extensive internal testing.

**Scope**: It defines the areas to cover in testing and which are not to
test areas in the software. It also provides data to be used for
testing.

**Test approach**: It includes the focus areas and the parameters
against which software is tested such as functionality, user experience,
and responsiveness. It also provides information on how to log bugs with
proof, a screenshot or a video. A [bug tracking tool with screen
capture](https://reqtest.com/features/capture-screenshot-tool/) can ease
off logging defects as it streamlines the process.

**Schedule**: It defines the timeline of the product, its start and end
date with time, number of cycles and time of the cycle.

**Tools:** It includes which tools will be used for bug tracking.

**Budget:** Creating an incentive plan for beta testers based on the
allocated budget.

**Feedback:**  Collecting and gathering feedback and evaluating the
software

**Review:** The entry and exit criteria for beta testing

**Entry**

  - Beta testing starts right after [Alpha
    testing](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/alpha-testing-basics/).
  - Product’s beta version is ready to be tested.
  - User manuals are ready and published containing all the list of
    known issues.
  - Maintaining a log of bugs, feedback using a tool which can help in
    documentation as well.

**Exit**

  - No critical bugs on desired platforms
  - Bugs identified are fixed
  - Summary report of the testing
  - Signing off beta testing

## Advantages

  - The software is tested by the end-users before releasing it in the
    market. It allows the development team to know what end users like
    in the software.
  - Customers can easily test software at their end to provide feedback.
  - Beta testers detect bugs and issues which were missed by the testing
    team which ensures high performance.
  - High quality of the software is released to the market.
  - Early users generate interest before the launch of the software.
  - It is a [cost-effective method to detect
    errors](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/how-to-reduce-the-cost-of-bugs/).

Blackbox Testing

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1640371028" class="expand-content">

The black box is a powerful technique to check the application under
test from the user’s perspective. Black box testing is used to test the
system against external factors responsible for software failures. This
testing approach focuses on the input that goes into the software, and
the output that is produced. The testing team does not cover the inside
details such as code, server logic, and development method.

Black box testing is based on the requirements and checks the system to
validate against predefined requirements.

Various parameters checked in black box testing are:

  - Accurate actions performed by users
  - System’s interaction with the inputs
  - The response time of the system
  - Use of data structures Issues in the user interface
  - Usability issues
  - Performance issues
  - Abrupt application failure, unable to start or finish

![](https://reqtest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/black-box-testing-big.png)

## Boundary Value Analysis

It is the widely used black-box testing, which is also the basis for
equivalence testing. Boundary value analysis tests the software with
test cases with extreme values of test data. BVA is used to identify the
flaws or errors that arise due to the limits of input data.

For example: Taking inputs for a test case data for an age section
should accept a valid data of anything between 1-100. According to BVP
analysis, the software will be tested against four test data as -1, 1,
100, and 101 to check the system’s response using the boundary values.

## Equivalence partitioning

This test case designing techniques checks the input and output by
dividing the input into equivalent classes. The data must be tested at
least once to ensure maximum test coverage of data. It is the exhaustive
form of testing, which also reduces the redundancy of inputs.

For example: Taking inputs for a test case data for the example
mentioned above will have three classes from which one data will be
tested.

Valid class: 1 to 100 (any number), Invalid class: -1 (checking the
lowest of lowest), Invalid class: 101(highest of highest).

## State Transition Testing

This testing technique uses the inputs, outputs, and the state of the
system during the testing phase. It checks the software against the
sequence of transitions or events among the test data.

Based on the type of software that is tested, it checks for the
behavioral changes of a system in a particular state or another state
while maintaining the same inputs.

For example, A login page will let you input username and password until
three attempts. Each incorrect password will be sent the user to the
login page. After the third attempt, the user will be sent to an error
page. This state transition method considers the various states of the
system and the inputs to pass only the right sequence of the testing.

## Decision Table Testing

This approach creates test cases based on various possibilities. It
considers multiple test cases in a [decision
table](https://reqtest.com/requirements-blog/a-guide-to-using-decision-tables/)
format where each condition is checked and fulfilled, to pass the test
and provide accurate output. It is preferred in case of various input
combinations and multiple possibilities.

For example, A food delivery application will check various payment
modes as input to place the order — decision making based on the table.

Case1: If the end-user has a card, then the system will not check for
cash or coupon and will take action to place the order.

Case2: If the end-user has a coupon will not be checked for a card or
cash and action will be taken.

Case3: if the end-user has cash, the action will be taken.

Case4: If the end-user doesn’t have anything, then action will not be
taken.

## Graph-Based Testing

It is similar to a decision-based test case design approach where the
relationship between links and input cases are considered.

## **Error Guessing Technique**

This method of designing test cases is about guessing the output and
input to fix any errors that might be present in the system. It depends
on the skills and judgment of the tester.

Comparison testing

This method uses the two different versions of the same software to
compare and validate the results.

Exploratory Testing

</div>

<div id="expander-content-116618635" class="expand-content">

This process of testing software gives complete freedom to the tester to
set guidelines and process to test the software.

This is a creative form of testing where a tester’s competency, skills,
and comprehension is used to explore the software. It is a continuous
process which uncovers defects.

Let’s take an example to understand exploratory testing. An e-commerce
portal is under development and the final rounds of testing are going
on. There is a new payment option “e-wallet” added into the payment
section of the portal.

The test manager has a high-level plan to perform exploratory testing.
He asks a tester who has thoroughly tested the payment gateway earlier
to perform exploratory testing on the new payment option. The tester
from his previous experience of what could possibly go wrong in the
payment option, test the new e-wallet option thoroughly.

![](https://reqtest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Exploratory-Testing-big.png)

The tester records his testing session through a [screen capture
tool](https://reqtest.com/features/capture-screenshot-tool/). He reports
a bug with a video screen capture of the bug to the developer. The
developer is able to reproduce the bug with the help of the video with
voice over attached in the bug reported.

Here we cover three critical aspects of exploratory testing first there
is a high-level plan to perform the testing and to be able to track what
should be covered in the tests. Secondly, the tester uses his own
competency and past experience to test the application as per his own
knowledge of the software under test. Thirdly, a tool was used for
effectively performing exploratory testing.

## Benefits

Here are the benefits of performing exploratory testing:

### Quick Testing

Exploratory testing works well when you have a time crunch which stops
you from writing detailed test cases to define the testing process. You
can start exploring the software and provide feedback quickly.

### Rapid feedback 

The exploratory testing process helps in getting quick feedback from
stakeholders as well even before the application is released. Explorers
can deal with any critical situation as they have in-depth knowledge of
software gained through previous iterations of testing. Exploratory
testing helps to refine the functionality and enhances the overall
software reliability. It reduces the risk of leaving any critical
defects at the last point of software release.

### Supports Agile 

It blends well with [agile
methodology](https://reqtest.com/agile-blog/agile-methodology-tutorial/)
and DevOps. It can sustain changes in requir

## Can be performed in five stages

### 1- Classification Of Bugs

  - It includes grouping the standard type of bugs as done in the
    previous projects.
  - Searching the root cause of the problem or issue.
  - Finding new ideas to check the application with risk analysis.

### 2- Creating A Test Charter 

Test charter is a statement document of exploratory testing which
defines the goal of the test session.

It explains three vital points:

  - What to test
  - How to test
  - What factors should be considered

The charter also describes the starting point of testing and defines how
the end user will use the system.

### 3- Creating A Time Box 

A time box is a time frame which sets the time limit of the testing
session. It has a start date and time with end date and time.

  - The method includes testers to be working together for e.g., 90
    minutes.
  - Nobody should interrupt them in those 90 minutes session.

The idea behind keeping the time box is to keep tester work to a decided
timeline.

### 4- Results 

  - It involves finding and reporting defects
  - Analysis and learning from testing
  - Analysis of coverage areas

### 5- Examining Results

  - It works on compiling the output results
  - Evaluating results with the charter
  - Checking any need of any additional testing
  - Analyze results before taking decisions related to quality and risk

## The Right Approach to Exploratory Testing

There are three different approaches to perform and evaluate any
software using exploratory Testing.

### 1\. Scenario-based Exploratory Testing

This type of exploratory testing is based on a particular scenario or
functionality which is tested. A tester can explore and find defects for
different structures and situations using this technique. The tester can
come up with a different test scenario to cover various situations.

### 2\. Strategy Based Exploratory Testing

The strategy based testing is defined by various other factors such as
risk evaluation, equivalence technique, and [boundary value
technique](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/what-is-boundary-value-analysis-and-equivalence-partitioning/).
The tester implements multiple procedures to check and improve the
efficiency of the application under test.

### 3\. Freestyle Exploratory Testing

As the name suggests this type of testing that doesn’t have a defined
structure. It is implemented when the tester has to perform smoke
testing. It lacks approach, a scenario like other forms of testing. A
tester has to explore the entire website or application to find defects
without any structured plan.

Greybox Testing

</div>

<div id="expander-content-774915019" class="expand-content">

For the uninitiated, Grey Box testing refers to the (apparent)
*Amalgamation* of White Box and Black Box testing.

[**White Box
testing**](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/white-box-testing-example/)
gives the tester a clear view of how the system ‘hangs together’ – that
is, how the various components and subsystems integrate and share
information. The tester is therefore able to look for and test specific
functionality and scenarios to give the system a good shake.

> *“Grey Box Testing Brings The Principles Of Both White Box And Black
> Box Testing Together.”*

**Black Box testing** is necessarily a situation where the tester
understands the needs the system is required to meet, and the Input and
Output requirements. And goes about testing these, while being oblivious
to the internal workings of the system.

Black Box testing can be seen as a means to test the basic functionality
that a system or software product is expected to fulfil, and should be
good enough to move a product to the next phase of development if you
are in iterative development mode.

White Box testing will help you test for the exceptional scenarios,
catch those difficult to catch bugs and help get the product ready for
release.

Grey Box Testing brings the principles of both White Box and Black Box
testing together. It refers to situations where the tester is only
exposed to intricate details about specific system components and
functionality that they are required to test and validate, while the
rest of the system can remain a Black box. It can at times refer to
situations where your **primary focus is in catching bugs with one or a
few system components**, and not necessarily the rest.

In simple terms,

**Grey Box Testing = White Box Testing + Black Box Testing**

Grey Box Testers generally have **access to design documents,
architecture diagrams** and other supporting information to give them an
idea of the internal workings of a system or system component.

## Why is Grey Box Testing important?

  - Testing happens from the point of view of the user – i.e., the
    consumer of your product. This is one of the benefits of Black box
    testing and carries over to Grey box testing.
  - Testing *Also* happens from the point of view of the developer –
    with some characteristics of White Box testing still intact, the
    Tester is able to see the system from the vantage point used by the
    one that designed it, and uncover more – sometimes uncommon but
    potentially very embarrassing – bugs.
  - Combined with other Testing efforts in a project, Grey Box testing
    comes in quite handy when you’re trying to clean up code. Like my
    example demonstrated above, you don’t know when an unseemly bug
    could rear up its head.
  - **Two brains are better than one**. Especially when those of a
    developer *And* a tester come together to catch bugs. That is the
    benefit Grey Box testing provides – by allowing the tester use the
    system design documents to design Test cases.
  - Fundamental benefit – this is Black box and White box testing
    combined into one. Need I say more?

GUI Testing

</div>

<div id="expander-content-359029376" class="expand-content">

Graphical User-interface Testing or GUI testing is a process of testing
the user interface of an application. In this article, you will learn
about the basics of GUI testing and how to do GUI testing and its
benefits.

A graphical user interface includes all the elements such as menus,
checkbox, buttons, colors, fonts, sizes, icons, content, and images. GUI
testing is done to check the functionality and usability of design
elements as a user for an application under test.

## Why do you need GUI testing?

Modern applications are beyond the desktop they are either mobile based
or cloud-based applications. They need to be more user-friendly as per
customer demand. The application interface and user experience play a
significant role in application success as it is released to the market.
A GUI testing team always pays close attention to each detail in visual
dynamics to ensure end-user satisfaction and ease.

![GUI
testing](https://reqtest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UI-testing-big.png)

It tests the various aspects of the user interface, such as:

  - Visual Design
  - Functionality
  - Security
  - Compliance
  - Usability
  - Performance

## Benefits of using GUI testing are:

  - It releases an error-free application software
  - It increases the efficiency of software
  - Improves software quality

## What we check in GUI Testing?

It extensively checks the user-interface of the application under test.

  - Testing the size, position, height, width of the visual elements
  - Verifying and testing the error messages are displayed or not
  - Testing different sections of the display screen
  - Verifying the usability of carousel arrows
  - Checking the navigation elements at the top of the page
  - Checking the message displayed, frequency and content
  - Verifying the functionality of proper filters and ability to
    retrieve results.
  - Checking alignment of radio buttons, drop downs
  - Verifying the title of each section and their correctness
  - Cross-checking the colors and its synchronization with the theme

## GUI Testing Approaches

There are three approaches to GUI testing:

### Manual Testing

This approach involves human tester, where each screen is manually
checked to validate each functionality by creating and [executing test
cases](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/test-management-planning-execution/).
It is a useful approach when part of UI or a feature is ready, the
probability of defects is more at the initial stage, and human
intervention is required.

It is convenient to use where the UI is unstable and go through a lot of
changes. It is viable for quick checks which can be done at any moment.
Moreover, [manual testing requires
expertise](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/manual-testing-strategy/)
and skills to validate design elements which are not possible without a
human tester.

### Record and Replay Testing

GUI record and replay tools are used to test applications for their user
interface. Using such tools, testers run an application and record the
user interaction with the app. A script runs to track and save the user
actions, including cursor movements, which can be replayed several times
to find the issues in the interface.

It also supports [automated regression
testing](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/regression-testing-types-techniques-tools/).
It is can be used for cross-browser testing. It is a convenient and
lightweight solution for testing. It doesn’t work well where you have
lots of iterations in the GUI of the applications. Recapturing and
replaying test cases to check functionality is time-consuming, and
tracking their updated version is a cumbersome process.

### Model-based testing

In this type of GUI testing, a model is created to understand and
evaluate the system’s behavior. This approach is useful in [creating
accurate test
cases](https://reqtest.com/tutorials/how-to-create-test-cases-in-reqtest/)
using system requirements. It is a structured, thorough, measurable form
of testing.

There are three essential aspects of model-based GUI testing:

  - Automatically generated test cases from the model
  - Manually derived test cases from the model
  - Model and requirements coverage metrics

There are tools which could automatically generate test based on the
model.

Things to consider for model-based testing:

  - Create the model
  - Determine the information as inputs in the system
  - Verifying the expected output
  - Execute tests
  - Checking and validating actual vs. expected
  - Take further action on the model

You can even derive test cases for GUI in two ways:

Charts: The charts display the state of the system and check the state
after some input.

Decision Tables: This helps in deciding the results for each input

Model-Based testing is preferred as the technique aligns with
requirements which define even the undesirable states a GUI can attain.

An automated test case generator produces test cases to cover all the
paths between start to finish stage. The number of test cases generated
automatically is large and it requires a lot of time to execute.

You need to implement a test case selection algorithm to reject all
inadequate scenarios for test cases. It means you need a test case
filter to select the required test cases as the set is too big and will
consume more time.

The above problem has one solution, opting for a manual approach to
finalize test cases. The process can be integrated with the automatic
generation of test scripts after tester manually shortlist the test
cases.

So if we conclude saying model-based testing makes GUI testing easy then
yes it does. Only when it is used for a well-designed process where it
is easy to generate a test set by performing dummy testing and running
test cases. But it is not appropriate where a test set consumes a lot of
time in execution. Efforts are required in building a model and short
listing the test cases using an algorithm and test script generation,
which makes it expensive.

Whitebox Testing

</div>

<div id="expander-content-335612080" class="expand-content">

This being a refresher of sorts, let us begin by defining the technique.

White box testing refers to a scenario where (as opposed to [**black box
testing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing)), the tester
deeply understands the inner workings of the system or system component
being tested.

Gaining a deep understanding of the system or component is possible when
the tester understands these at program- or code-level. So almost all
the time, the tester needs to either understand or have access to the
source code that makes up the system – usually in the form of
specification documents.

Armed with the level of technical detail that is normally visible only
to a developer, a Tester will then be able to design and execute test
cases that cover all possible scenarios and conditions that the system
component is designed to handle.

We’ll see how this is done in our example later.

By performing testing at the most granular level of the system, you are
able to build a robust system that works exactly as expected, and ensure
it will not throw up any surprises whatsoever.

The key principles that assist you in executing white box tests
successfully are:

  - **Statement Coverage** – ensure every single line of code is tested.
  - **Branch Coverage** – ensure every branch (e.g. true or false) is
    tested.
  - **Path Coverage** – ensure all possible paths are tested.

And we know path coverage is favoured above branch coverage for the
sheer comprehensiveness it provides.

## When is White Box Testing appropriate?

You know by now, that such intensive testing is not for everyone or
every situation.

The rigour that white box Testing employs is quite useful – yes, but not
all the time.

white box Testing is usually reserved for mission critical systems and
components, because, well, such systems simply deserve the attention to
detail that this technique can bring.

> “The rigour that white box Testing employs is quite useful – yes, but
> not all the time.”

### Mission Critical

By mission critical, we mean for instance the Core Banking system that
provides the IT backbone to operate a Bank. The core banking system will
house all transactions and corresponding customer data, and helps run
the bank day-to-day.

Another example could be IT systems that help governments-run defence
operations.

Any system that provides such critical utility to a company,
organisation or government needs to be bug-free. **Any level of bugs or
downtime is unacceptable for such systems**, as they perform extremely
vital functions for the stakeholders involved.

It could quite literally mean a difference between life and death if
such systems do not work as expected:

  - Customers could be cut off from accessing their money when in life
    changing situations – say when they’re trying to pay for a loved
    one’s emergency treatment at a hospital.
  - An entire country’s security could be compromised by a
    malfunctioning IT system.

So where critical systems and components are involved, it is necessary
to ensure they are bug-free (well, almost). And making a mission
critical system bug-free in turn depends on employing extensive testing.

White box testing isn’t the be-all and end-all for critical systems
quality assurance. It is, however, **one of the central and
indispensable techniques**.

## Why is White Box Testing indispensable?

Simply because of what it is designed to do – i.e., test all possible
scenarios that a system can encounter. By testing at the source
code-level, a tester will be able to run through every single
permutation and combination that the program can theoretically spew out.

When testing happens at such granular level, this then brings any
possible defects out in the open. And your team will have an opportunity
to evaluate whether some or all of them need to be fixed.

## Step-by-Step White Box Testing Example

With that, let’s sink our teeth into a simple example of white box
testing. For this purpose, let’s consider the following sample journey:

A customer needs to transfer money to a friend who lives abroad. They’re
going to use the mobile banking service provided by their bank to do
this.

### Step 1: Identify the feature, component, program to be tested

Zero in on what you want to test.

When it comes to white box testing, the smaller your target system
component, the better it is. Given what we’re trying to achieve – test
all possible scenarios and cases for a given feature – individually
testing individual features helps you focus on a small enough area of
the code.

A narrower focus also implies the ability to be more thorough. Remember,
in a lot of the cases, you’re doing white box testing mainly because
that specific system, feature, component is critical and needs to be
tested through and through **to guarantee it works as expected** .

> “A narrower focus also implies the ability to be more thorough.”

So, you should try and identify the smallest logical module or component
for the system being tested, and work on this first. When you’re
finished testing this module, you can move on to the next one.

**Taking on a larger scope**

Yes – it is possible that you’d take on white box testing for entire
systems. Where the system involved is critical, draping it in white box
testing will give you a high degree of confidence about code quality and
resilience.

However, you need to weigh the effort involved versus the benefits
derived. white box Testing is often labour intensive and will consume
considerable resource. So it is important to balance effort with need.

> “White box Testing is often labour intensive and will consume
> considerable resource. So it is important to balance effort with
> need.”

### Step 2: Plot all possible paths in a flowgraph

This step covers a big portion of your preparation to plan and execute
white box Testing successfully.

As with any effort – be it development or testing – understanding
‘Scope’ is paramount.

And, we already know that Path Coverage provides a comprehensive
solution to Test coverage.

Here, we’re trying to understand all the possible paths that can be
tested for a given feature, component, module… Identifying all possible
paths helps in writing test cases to cover each one of them. And the
best way to do this, is to draw a flowgraph that brings out these paths.

Consider the example below:

![Sample Journey
Flowchart](https://reqtest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sample-Journey1.png)

Obviously, transferring funds from your bank account isn’t this simple.
Sure, for some of us it can feel like it, but that’s because we don’t
normally face the exceptions that quite a few others encounter when
attempting to move money.

Having said that, this *Simple* flowgraph will do nicely to demonstrate
white box Testing.

To complete the flowgraph, you may need to refer to the following:

  - User journeys, use cases
  - Program specifications
  - Technical specifications, pseudocode

### Step 3: Identify all possible paths from the flowgraph

Now, as you can see from Figure 1, there are two possible paths for this
journey:

1.  1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and
2.  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7

Being a simple example, only two paths exist to this journey.
Nevertheless, you get the idea. Identify every permutation and
combination for how the journey could flow from start to end. Identify
any midway drop off points. And you’re all set.

### Step 4: Write Test Cases to cover every single path on the flowgraph

When you have all available paths plotted on the flowgraph, then go
ahead and write test cases to test each of these paths.

When you have a bunch of test cases that you are confident will cover
every single path, you’re ready to go to the execution phase.

### Step 5: Execute, rinse, repeat

You’re now ready to execute white box Testing for the identified system,
component or module. And you have the flowgraph and Test Cases necessary
to complete Testing.

That, in simple terms, is how you plan and execute white box Testing.

You can also refer to this blog, which does a good job of explaining how
to approach white box testing too.

Usability

</div>

<div id="expander-content-891917626" class="expand-content">

Usability Testing is a non-functional testing technique to evaluate how
easily the end users can use a product or a service.  The goal of
usability testing is to detect any usability problems by collecting
qualitative and quantitative data to determine the satisfaction of
representative users with the product.

This testing helps to gain insights from the users to find out whether
the users’ expectations are met or not.  It helps to check if the user
can perform the functionality offered by the product easily. The
reactions and feedback of representative users allow finding out that if
the product is on the right track.

Usability testing identifies the areas where the user struggle with the
product. It helps to make recommendations for improvements.  A
successful usability testing will result in improvement in the design of
the product.

The stakeholders and development team members watch, listen, collect
data and take notes during usability testing.  As this testing involves
real users, it provides insights on performance, error rate and task
success. Usability testing helps the developers and designers to develop
a solution that supports workflow and tasks.

![usability testing
big](https://reqtest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/usability-testing-big.png)

## When to do Usability Testing?

You can perform usability testing at various development stages:

### Low fidelity prototype

A wireframe or a mock version of a product or website that allows
testing before the development starts.

###  High-fidelity prototype

An interactive system that includes representative data and imitates the
user experience the end users will get with the finished product.

### Alpha and Beta versions

Remote participants for a usability test can access these versions.

###  Release version

A product released to customers that can help to test the workflow of
the product from beginning to end.

### Comparative or A/B

There are multiple versions of a design that helps to measure the
difference in performance and satisfaction.

## Steps to perform usability testing

  - [Create a test
    plan](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/how-to-write-a-test-plan-2/)
  - Facilitate the test
  - Analyze case data
  - Create a test report

### Creating a test plan

The first step would be to [create a test plan that will help you to
perform
good](https://reqtest.com/testing-blog/software-test-plan-template-2/)
usability testing. Here are the tasks for creating a test plan:

### Define the scope of work

You have to decide which areas of your product you want to test. Create
a list of all the areas and ensure to not go beyond 12 areas to test.

###  Recruit users

The next very critical step is to recruit users who will give you
insight into usability. Select the users on the basis of their
demographics or psychographics. Psychographics considers the cognitive
background that covers whether the selected users usually perform the
proposed scenarios or not.

You should recruit at least 5 users and a maximum of 15 users per user
persona. The 5 users per segment will give you enough insights on the
user behavior.

###  Identify objectives

You should have a clear picture of what you want to accomplish with the
usability test. You should also know what you want to [demonstrate to
your
stakeholders](https://reqtest.com/requirements-blog/how-to-identify-stakeholders/).

### Establish metrics

For a fact-based description of the performance, you need metrics which
help you to make informed design decisions. The important metrics are
time on a task, task performance, success rate, speed, expectation
matching, and goal fulfillment. There could be many more metrics on the
basis of your project.

### Facilitate the test

To facilitate the test you need to perform the following:

  - Ask your users about their thoughts and feeling as and when they
    interact with the solution
  - Take notes irrespective of whether they are structured or
    unstructured
  - Record the session
  - Let the user take the lead
  - Don’t make conclusions early on during the session
  - It’s important to know how your user perceives the solution

Usability testing gives the following results:

Quantitative information- Time on tasks, success and failure rates,
effort (\#clicks, perception of progress)

Qualitative information-Stress responses, subjective satisfaction,
perceived effort or difficulty

Author: [Clinton Montroos](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~clintonm)

  

1.  **Spelling mistakes:**
      - Sometimes, spelling mistake can create a lot of confusions or
        make a sentence difficult to understand.
2.  **Grammar:**
      - If grammar is not proper then test case can be interpreted in a
        wrong way, resulting in wrong results.
3.  **Template format:**
      - If proper template is followed then it becomes easy to
        add/modify test cases in future and test case plan looks
        organized.
4.  **Standard/Guidelines:**
      - While review process, it is very important to check whether all
        the standards and guideline are properly followed.
5.  **Language used:**
      - *Test cases* should have a very simple language which is easy to
        understand.
6.  **Functionality coverage:**
      - It is highly recommended that all the functionality associated
        with the system under test should be covered so that major
        defects are not missed.
7.  **Replication:**
      - It refers to the duplicate test cases removal. It is possible
        that two or more test cases test the same thing and can be
        merged into one, this would save time and space.
8.  **Redundancy:**
      - It refers to uselessness of a test case due to change in
        requirements or some modifications. Such test cases must be
        removed.

**Defect Types**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

A bug or "issue" is an unexpected behavior or malfunction in the
functionality or design of a product.  
Put simply, a bug is something that isn't working quite right. For
example, have you ever experienced an app suddenly quit when you tap a
button? Or maybe you have tried to upload a new profile picture, but
after 19 uploads the app still shows an empty space where your face
should be? Well, those were bugs.

Bug types can be summed up into 5 categories:

<div id="expander-1419495812" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1419495812" class="expand-control">

Functional

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1419495812" class="expand-content">

Functional issues are workflow failures where something in the test
application did not work as it was design to. These issues produce an
unexpected or illogical application behavior where the end result
differs from the expected result.

Examples:

  - Broken page links
  - Search and filters return incorrect results
  - Button does not respond when clicked

</div>

</div>

<div id="expander-420454488" class="expand-container">

Visual

</div>

<div id="expander-content-420454488" class="expand-content">

Visual issues affect the layout and cause user interface distortion such
as missing elements or images on a page.

Examples:

  - Page elements or content is misaligned
  - Content does not fit the area it is in
  - Inconsistent colors on a link, button or menu
  - Picture is missing

</div>

Content

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1210618016" class="expand-content">

Content issues affect the text of a page, such as spelling, grammar and
localization errors.

Examples:

  - Localization issues where the wrong word is used in page
    translations
  - Spelling and capitalization errors such as mikeJones
  - Punctuation is used incorrectly in text ( , . : ; ' " )

Performance

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1371861883" class="expand-content">

Problematic slowness or hanging, sluggish interface. Features take
longer to load than they should, slow navigation in the application.  
Examples:

  - Application reacts slowly when navigating throughout features
  - Application or pages take too long to load
  - Application freezes or becomes unresponsive

</div>

</div>

<div id="expander-1437403100" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1437403100" class="expand-control">

Crash

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1437403100" class="expand-content">

Application quits or closes unexpectedly while using the features.  
Examples:

  - Web - page hangs and doesn't respond, ultimately resulting with an
    error, or the browser closes
  - Computer - application freezes the device, hangs for a long time or
    closes abruptly
  - Mobile - applications close abruptly with an error

Writing a quality bug report is a learned skill that takes time and
practice to develop. You should keep in mind the tips below when writing
bug reports.

## Recreate the bug numerous times to understand it

Before you begin writing a bug report, make sure to recreate the bug
numerous times so that you understand it well and can explain these
three things clearly:

  - What the bug is
  - How to recreate it
  - What happens when the bug is recreated

## Testers need to explain bugs clearly and provide proof

As a tester, it is your job to explain the bug clearly and provide proof
of the bug so that the TTL or customer can recreate and understand it.

## The bug title explains what the bug is

Write the title that clearly explains what the bug is.

## Numbered steps explaining how to recreate the bug

Write numbered steps that describe exactly what a user has to do to
recreate the bug.

## Clearly explain what was expected and what happened

Clearly explain the expected and actual results of the bug. That means
what the user expected to happen and then what did happen, when carrying
out the steps.

## Create and include all required proof of the bug

Finally, create and include all required (useful) attachments:

  - Screenshots
  - Screen recordings
  - Device logs

Record your steps.

TestRail Guide

# All Manual API and Manual UI Test cases SHOULD be documented in TestRail.

# Checklist when documenting Manual Test cases in TestRail

1.  The Test Project name format should start with capital letter.

<!-- end list -->

2.  By default, all Test projects will use a single repository. But if
    your Test case has different phases, you can configure that in the
    settings to use multiple Test suites.

(Administration \> Projects \> Select your Project \> Select one of the
options)

3.  Create a section

c) Specify under which Test type this Test case belongs (e.g.,
functional, non-functional, automated, regression, etc.)  

d) Set the priority (e.g., Medium, High and Low). The answer can be
found based on the Requirements priority.  

e) If the Test case is based on a card in Jira, you can add the

)  

b) Assign the Test run to yourself  

c) When a test case fails:  

1.  Enter the Actual Result in the comments  
2.  Push the Defect to JIRA with all of the fields configured.

How can I find a bug?  
Most applications and websites have similar features, such as: a
homepage, sign up, login, my account, search, check out and so on. When
testing, and searching for bugs try to use the app as a normal user
would use it in the real world. Keep an eye out for anything that
doesn't seem to be working, or is doing something completely different
than a normal user would expect. Here are some examples of things to do
while testing:

## User registration and login

  - Log in using Google and Facebook accounts
  - Register a regular email account
  - Try to register using invalid credentials (note this is not always
    in scope)
  - Use the forgot password feature to retrieve your account

## My account page

  - Change your password
  - Upload a profile image and change the image too
  - Change and apply all of the different account settings
  - See that all pages and features in the account page are available
    and functional

## Checkout, cart, wish list

  - Add and remove items from the cart
  - Add and remove items from the wish list
  - Like different items (and try to remove the like too)
  - Click on the checkout button to verify the items in your cart (Do
    not complete purchases while testing)

## Homepage

  - Click on all of the different buttons, links and features
  - Observe all images are displayed correctly and respond as expected
  - Menu - verify that a user can navigate through the features of the
    website or app
  - Design - verify the page is aligned properly to the screen's default
    size

## Search and Filter

  - Use the search functionality and to explore the features, products
    and various pages
  - Try searching with invalid data (spaces or with no input, note this
    may not be in scope)
  - Select different colors, sizes and designs of products
  - Apply multiple filters at one time
  - Use the remove all filters button
  - Open the filtered results and return back (observe the filter
    behavior)
  - Verify filters show the correct amount of results

## Footer links

  - About us page
  - Contact us page
  - Sitemap - links to all the pages on the product (useful for getting
    familiar with a website)

**Git's Commit Process**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

Regardless of the tool you use to interact with Git repository. The
commit workflow is as shown in the diagram below.

![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*mQdKYVN0nl-NvTw6MOSkWA.png)

  - Workspace  - simply a set of git repositories on your local system
  - Index - The Git index is used as a staging area between your working
    directory and your repository. You can use the index to build up a
    set of changes that you want to commit together. When you create a
    commit, what is committed is what is currently in the index, not
    what is in your working directory.
  - Local Repository -
  - Remote Repository - "Bitbucket"

  

</div>

</div>

  

#### **Git Flow Way (Recommended)**

1.  Scenario 1 - Day to Day
    1.  Developers will create a Feature branch by using git flow.
    2.  When the developer is finished coding, finish branch (deal with
        conflict if any, commit and retry finishing again) this will
        auto merge back to Develop branches.
    3.  Create a Release branch by using git flow when ready to create
        deployments for QA/UAT/Prod.
    4.  After deployment to production and code-base is stable, finish
        the Release branch by using git flow, this will auto merge to
        Master and Develop.
2.  Scenario 2 - HotFix
    1.  Developer will create a Hotfix branch by using git flow.
    2.  When the developer is finished fix and is ready to deploy to
        production, merge Hotfix to Master and Develop branches.

#### **Manual Way**

1.  Scenario 1 - Day to Day
    1.  Developers will create a Feature branch off Develop or
        Development to work off.
    2.  When the developer is finished coding, ("get latest" and deal
        with conflict) merge back to Develop branch.
    3.  Create a Release branch when it is ready.
    4.  After deployment to production, merge Release branch to Master.
2.  Scenario 2 - HotFix
    1.  Developer will create a Hotfix branch off Master to work off
    2.  When the developer is finished and has been deployed to
        production, merge Hotfix to Master and Develop branches

  

  

  

#### Notes

1.  Always "get latest" to your branch before you merge. Good practice -
    every morning and before you commit update your branch.
2.  Pending on the source control Project/Repository there may be
    mandatory code review when doing a Pull Request.  Refer to the Pull
    Request section below
3.

Git Data Transport Commands

</div>

<div id="expander-content-284111044" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

Git keeps copies of your source tree in the locations in this diagram .
(I’ll call these locations “data stores”.)

![](https://images.osteele.com/2008/git-transport.png)![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/11/vcs.png)

  

The data store that’s new, relative to every other DVCS that I know
about, is the “index”. The one that’s new relative to centralized VCS’s
such as Subversion and Perforce is the “local repository”.

The illustration shows that `git add` is the only (everyday) operation
that can cause the index to diverge from the local repository. The only
reason (in Subversion-emulation mode) to use `git add` is so that `git
commit` will see your changes. The `-a`option to `git commit` causes
`git commit` to run `git add -u` first – in which case you never need
to`run git add -u` explicitly – in which case the index stays in sync
with the repository head. This is how the trick in “git without the
index” works: if you always use commit via `git commit -a`, you can
ignore the index.

  

So what’s the point of the index? Is it because Linus likes complicated
things? Is to one-up all the other repositories? Is it to increase the
complexity of system, so that you have a chance to shoot yourself in the
foot if you’re not an alpha enough geek?

  

Well, probably. But it’s good for something else as well. Several
things, actually; I’ll show you one (that I use), and point you to
another.

But first, a piece of background that helps in understanding Git. Git
isn’t at its core a VCS. It’s really a distributed versioning file
system, down to its
own[fsck](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fsck.html)and[gc](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-gc.html).
It was developed as the bottom layer of a VCS, but the VCS layer, which
provides the conventional VCS commands (`commit`,`checkout`,`branch`),
is more like an uneven veneer than like the “porcelain” it’s sometimes
called: bits of file system (git core) internals poke through.

The disadvantage of this (leaky) layering is that Git is complicated. If
you look up how to diff against yesterday’s 1pm sources in[git
diff](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html), it
will send you to[git
rev-parse](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rev-parse.html)from
the core; if you look up[git
checkout](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout.html),
you may end up
at[git-check-ref-format](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-check-ref-format.html).
Most of this you can ignore, but it takes some reading to figure out
which.

The advantage of the layering is that you can use Git to build your own
workflows. Some of these workflows involve the index. Like the other
fancy Git features, building your own workflows is something that you
can ignore initially, and add when you get to where you need it. This
is, historically, how I’ve used the index: I ignored it until I was
comfortable with more of Git, and now I use it for a more productive
workflow than I had with other VCS’s. It’s not my main reason for using
Git, but it’s turned to a strength from being a liability.

<div id="expander-content-17553534" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

This is why no matter how many git commands or tips ‘n tricks you
memorize or store in your git cheatsheet, without understanding of how
git works*under the hood*you will remain confused with the strange ways
of git because those git internals will every once in a while leak
through the abstraction layer git’s (frontend) commands give you.

So in this**Understanding Git**series we will cover git’s internals (we
will not go into git’s source code don’t worry) and first thing on that
list is git’s heart and soul — the**data model**.

To start, we will initialise and empty git repository in our project
directory:

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> git init
> ```

Git will inform us it has created a `.git`directory in our project’s
directory so let’s take a quick peak at how it looks like:

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> $ tree .git/
> ```
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--pre
> .git/
> ├── HEAD
> ├── config
> ├── description
> ├── hooks
> │   ├── applypatch-msg.sample
> │   ├── commit-msg.sample
> │   ├── post-update.sample
> │   ├── pre-applypatch.sample
> │   ├── pre-commit.sample
> │   ├── pre-push.sample
> │   ├── pre-rebase.sample
> │   ├── pre-receive.sample
> │   ├── prepare-commit-msg.sample
> │   └── update.sample
> ├── info
> │   └── exclude
> ├── objects
> │   ├── info
> │   └── pack
> └── refs
>     ├── heads
>     └── tags
> ```
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--pre
> 8 directories, 14 files
> ```

Some of these files and directories may sound familiar to you
(particularly`HEAD`) but for now we will focus on
the `.git/objects`directory which is empty right now, but we will
change that in a moment.

Let’s create an`index.php`file

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> touch index.php
> ```

give it some content

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> <?php
> echo "Hello World";
> ```

and a`README.md`file

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> touch README.md
> ```

and give it some content too:

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> # Description
> This is my hello world project
> ```

Now let’s stage and commit them:

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> git add .
> git commit -m "Initial Commit"
> ```

OK, nothing special here, adding and committing — we’ve all “been there,
done that”.

If we take a look again at our `.git`directory we can see that
the `.git/objects`directory has some subdirectories and files now:

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> ├── objects
> │   ├── 5d
> │   │   └── 92c127156d3d86b70ae41c73973434bf4bf341
> │   ├── a6
> │   │   └── dbf05551541dc86b7a49212b62cfe1e9bb14f2
> │   ├── cf
> │   │   └── 59e02c3d2a2413e2da9e535d3c116af1077906
> │   ├── f8
> │   │   └── 9e64bdfcc08a8b371ee76a74775cfe096655ce
> │   ├── info
> │   └── pack
> ```

*(Note: directories and files can/will have different names on you
computer)*

We will get back to `.git/objects`but for now notice that every
directory name is two characters long. Git generates a 40-character
checksum (SHA-1) hash for every object and the first two characters of
that checksum are used as directory name and the other 38 as file
(object) name.

The first kind of objects that git creates when we commit some file(s)
are**blob**objects, in our case two of them, one for each file we
committed:

![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*grJYh5IvV9-ZfeHPxLzF0Q.png)

    Blob objects associated with our index.php and README.md files

They contain snapshots of our files (content of our files at the time of
the commit) and have their checksum header.

The next kind of objects git creates are**tree**objects. In our case
there is only one and it contains a list of all files in our project
with a pointer to the blob objects assigned to them (this is how git
associates your files with their blob objects):

![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*sWI76t410z2Lh4ZfuAA30Q.png).

    Tree object pointing to blob objects

And finally git creates a**commit**object that has a pointer to it’s
tree object (along with some other information):

![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*G2XdqybWn9KQTdH3QXGrIw.png)

    Commit object points to it’s tree object

If we look back at our `.git/objects`directory things should look
clearer now.

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> ├── objects
> │   ├── 5d
> │   │   └── 92c127156d3d86b70ae41c73973434bf4bf341
> │   ├── a6
> │   │   └── dbf05551541dc86b7a49212b62cfe1e9bb14f2

> │   │   └── 59e02c3d2a2413e2da9e535d3c116af1077906

> │   │   └── 9e64bdfcc08a8b371ee76a74775cfe096655ce
> │   ├── info
> │   └── pack
> ```

With`git log`we can see our commit history:

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> commit a6dbf05551541dc86b7a49212b62cfe1e9bb14f2 
> Author: zspajich <zspajich@gmail.com>
> Date:   Tue Jan 23 13:31:43 2018 +0100
> ```
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--pre
> Initial Commit
> ```

And using the naming convention we mentioned earlier we can find our
commit object in `.git/object` :

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> ├── objects
> │   ├── a6
> │   │   └── dbf05551541dc86b7a49212b62cfe1e9bb14f2
> ```

To look at it’s content we can’t simply use`cat`command since these are
not plain text files but git has a`cat-file`command we can use:

> git cat-file commit a6dbf05551541dc86b7a49212b62cfe1e9bb14f2

to get the content of our commit object:

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> tree f89e64bdfcc08a8b371ee76a74775cfe096655ce

Here we see the pointer to our commit’s tree object and to examine it’s
content we use`git ls-tree`command:

> git ls-tree f89e64bdfcc08a8b371ee76a74775cfe096655ce

and as expected it does contain a list of our files with pointers to
their blob objects:

> 
> 
> ``` graf graf--pre graf-after--p
> 100644 blob cf59e02c3d2a2413e2da9e535d3c116af1077906 README.md
> 100644 blob 5d92c127156d3d86b70ae41c73973434bf4bf341 index.php
> ```

We can look at blob object representing (for
example)`index.php`with`cat-file`command:  

> git cat-file blob 5d92c127156d3d86b70ae41c73973434bf4bf341

and we see that it contains our`index.php`file’s content

> \<?  
> echo "Hello World\!"

  

So that is what happens when we create and commit some files.

Now we’ll do another commit, this time let’s say we made some changes to
our`index.php`file (added some code magic) and commited those changes:

![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*n5SQmlV-80O70sYxXUzZng.png)

    Git creates a new blob object for the file that has changed

As we see, git has now created a new blob object with a new snapshot
of`index.php`. Since`README.md`hasn’t changed, no new blob object for it
is created, git will reuse the existing one instead (we’ll see in a
second how).

Now, when git creates a tree**object, blob pointer assigned
to`index.php`is updated and blob pointer assigned to`README.md`simply
stays the same as in the previous commit’s tree.

![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*O260Gac6Z03eVBnpajqOgA.png)

    Pointer to index.php blob is updated and pointer to README.md blob stays the same

And at the end, git creates a commit object with a pointer to it’s tree
object

![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*7cO1qJI8GjAmxoIwuatEPg.png)

    Commit object points to it’s tree and also has a pointer to it’s parent commit object

and also a pointer to it’s parent*commit*object (every commit except the
first one has at least one parent).

So now that we know how git handles file adding and editing, the only
thing that remains is to see how it handles file deletion:

![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*qRna_KHBVWGmcQTVuYIeaA.png)

    Git deletes the entry for index.php in tree object

It’s very simple — git deletes the file entry (file name with pointer to
it’s blob object) from the tree object. In this case we
deleted`index.php`in our commit so there is no longer an`index.php`entry
in that commit’s tree object (in other words, our commit’s tree object
no longer has a pointer to a blob object representing`index.php`).

There is just one more addition to this[data
model](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/data-model)we presented— tree
objects can be nested (they can point to other tree objects). You can
think of it this way: every blob object represents a file and every tree
object represents a directory, so if we have nested directories we will
have nested tree objects.

Let’s look at an example:

![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*TYfg6X9HNjyk_6G06B3wMQ.png)

    Tree objects can point to other tree objects

Here, our project would have one`README.md`file and one app directory
with two files (`app.php`and`app_dev.php`).

Git uses blob objects to recreate the content of our files at any given
point in time (commit) and tree objects to reproduce our project’s
folder structure.

So there you have have it - git’s***data model***. It is in fact a
simple data model and
in[next](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-git-branching-2662f5882f9)post
we’ll look at branching and how git’s data model makes branching very
cheap and simple.

If you wish to dig deeper**into git’s data model I would recommend
this[lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR433b0HJY)from Scott
Chacon and also going through[Git
Internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)chapter
from his[Git Pro](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)book.

Git represents history in a fundamentally different way than centralized
version controls systems (CVCS) such as Team Foundation Version Control,
Perforce, or Subversion. Centralized systems store a separate history
for each file in a repository.  Git stores history as a graph of
snapshots of the entire repository. These snapshots—which are called
commits in Git—can have multiple parents, creating a history that looks
like a graph instead of a straight line. This difference in history is
incredibly important and is the main reason users familiar with CVCS
find Git confusing.

![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*dY7Zq4fC4cVKdRDdiQ0QLg.png)

A core concept — once you can visualize it, you can troubleshoot and
recover from those weird Git situations you inevitably find yourself in
— is the way that commits relate to each other. And the wildly
accurate and incredibly unhelpful description of that way is “a directed
acyclic graph.” (Although, when I sat down to write this, my dashboard
contained a link to this cheerful deep-dive with illustrations:[Spinning
Around In Cycles With Directed Acyclic
Graphs](https://medium.com/basecs/spinning-around-in-cycles-with-directed-acyclic-graphs-a233496d4688).)

  

## Commit history basics

  

Start with a simple history example: a repo with 3 linear commits.

![three commits in a
line](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/_img/history-abc-1.png)

Commit A is the parent of commit B, and commit B is the parent of commit
C. This history looks very similar to a CVCS. The arrow pointing to
commit C is a branch. It’s named master because that’s the default name
for the mainline branch in a Git repo. Branches are pointers to specific
commits, which is why branching is so lightweight and easy in Git.

A key difference in Git compared to CVCS is that I have my own full copy
of the repo. I need to keep my local repository in sync with the remote
repository by getting the latest commits from the remote repository. To
do this, I’ll pull the master branch with the following command:

> git pull origin master

This merges all changes from the master branch in the remote repository,
which Git names`origin`by default . This pull brought one new commit and
the master branch in my local repo moves to that commit.

![a fourth commit, D, is added to the
line](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/_img/history-abcd-1.png)  

## Understand branch history

Now I want to make a change to my code. It’s common to have multiple
active branches where you’re working on different features in parallel.
This is in stark contrast to CVCS where new branches are heavy and
rarely created. The first step is to checkout to a new branch using the
following command:

>  git checkout -b cool-new-feature

This is a shortcut combining two commands:`git branch
cool-new-feature`to create the branch followed by`git checkout
cool-new-feature`to begin working in the branch.

![Branch cool-new-feature is
added](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/_img/history-abcd-cool-new-feature-1.png)

Two branches now point to the same commit. I’ll make a few changes on
the`cool-new-feature`branch in two new commits, E and F.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/_img/history-abcd-cool-new-feature-e-f-1.png)

My commits are reachable by the`cool-new-feature`branch since I made
them in that branch. I’m done with my feature and want to merge it into
the master branch. To do that I’ll use the following command:

> `git merge cool-feature master`

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/_img/history-abcd-cool-new-feature-e-f-merge-1.png)

The graph structure of history becomes visible when there’s a merge. Git
creates a new commit when I merged my branch into another branch. This
is a merge commit. There aren’t any changes included this merge commit
since I didn’t have conflicts. If I had conflicts, the merge commit
would include the changes needed to resolve those conflicts.

## History in the real world

Here is an example of Git history that more closely resembles code in
active development on a team. There are three people who merge commits
from their own branches into the master branch around the same time.

![console log of git
graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/_img/gitlogconsole.png)

Now that you understand how branches and merges create the shape of the
graph, this shouldn’t be too scary\!

## Why should you write good commit messages?

You might say, "It's just a personal project," but yes, you work alone
now, but what happens when you work with a team or contribute to open
source?

A well-crafted commit message is the best way to communicate context
about a change to other developers working on that project and indeed to
your future self. Have you tried running history on your old projects to
see the "weird" commit messages you have used since inception? It
becomes hard for you to explain why you made some changes in the past,
and you wish you have read this article before now :).

Commit messages can adequately tell you why a change was made, and
understanding why a change was made makes development and collaboration
more efficient.

## How to write good commit messages

There are several conventions used by several teams and developers to
write good commit messages. I'll only outline some general rules and
tips for writing commit messages, you would have to decide what
convention you want to follow and if you work for a company or
contribute to open source, you would have to adapt to their convention
:).

For consistency, you can use one convention for work and another for
personal projects as you might change your job sometime, and the
convention might change.

> 
> 
> ``` language-bash
> Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
> 
> More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
> characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
> subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
> line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
> the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
> two together.
> 
> Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
> or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
> by commands like git merge and git revert.
> 
> Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
> 
> - Bullet points are okay, too
> 
> - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
>   single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
> 
> - Use a hanging indent
> 
> If you use an issue tracker, add a reference(s) to them at the bottom,
> like so:
> 
> Resolves: #123
> ```

Looks great, right? Here's how you can make yours great too:

1.  Specify the type of commit:

<!-- end list -->

  - **feat**:  The new feature you're adding to a particular application
  - **fix**: A bug fix
  - **style**: Feature and updates related to styling
  - **refactor**: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
  - **test**: Everything related to testing
  - **docs**: Everything related to documentation
  - **chore**: Regular code maintenance.  
    \[ You can also use emojis to represent commit types\]

<!-- end list -->

1.  Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
2.  Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors
3.  Remove unnecessary punctuation marks
4.  Do not end the subject line with a period
5.  Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
6.  Use the imperative mood in the subject line
7.  Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made
    them.
8.  Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem
    was, ensure you add it.
9.  Do not think your code is self-explanatory
10. Follow the commit convention defined by your team

When you create a pull request Bitbucket automatically compares the
source with your update and the destination with the original code. If
anyone else has made changes in the destination to the same code you
touched, we'll notify you of conflicts when you attempt to merge.

![](attachments/419988568/419988570.png)

When you have merge conflicts, you can't click the **Merge** button from
the pull request to merge. To resolve these conflicts, you pull the
changes to your local repository and fix them there. Merge conflicts may
look something like this:

## Resolving the conflict between Git branches

These steps include details for resolving conflicts between two branches
in a Git repository. You'll see references to these placeholders:

  - The directory to the forked repository as `<repo_directory>`
  - The destination branch as `<destination_branch>`
  - The source branch as `<feature_branch>`
  - The file with resolved conflicts as `<filename>`

  

## Resolving the conflict between Git forks

These steps include details for resolving conflicts between a forked
repository and its original Git repository. You'll see references to
these placeholders:

  - The directory to the forked repository as `<repo_directory>`
  - The URL of the original repository as `<original_repo_URL>`
  - The file with resolved conflicts as `<filename>`
  - The destination branch of the forked repository
    as `<destination_branch>`

[Git - Work with Pull
Requests](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/IT/Git+-+Work+with+Pull+Requests)

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

*Pull requests are an effective way to perform code review and
collaboration in a positive way in the team.*

## Pull requests offer

  - Complete diff (difference) of the changes to each file.
  - Automatic updates so you can see changes as they are made
  - Inline comments so you can pinpoint change suggestions
  - Tasks to help you keep track of what changes need attention
  - Notifications for comments, commits, or approvals
  - Two merge strategy options for Git repositories

Build better Pull Requests

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1933661904" class="expand-content">

Here are a few suggestions to make PULL REQUESTS more effective.

  - Try to make the pull request small enough to review but large enough
    to give you the context of the feature, bug fix, or update
  - Use @mentions  and in-line comments to guide specific reviewers to
    specific items in the code
  - Ask reviewers to create TASKS for things which must be addressed for
    APPROVAL. This helps designate between suggestions and discussions
    and things which must be fixed
  - An accurate description and links to any issues gives reviewers more
    context and better access to what they need to understand the
    problem or feature you're addressing

Compare before issuing a Request

</div>

<div id="expander-content-660555528" class="expand-content">

Before creating a Pull Request, you should compare your outgoing
Requests to the destination Repository.This tells you how much the
destination Repository changed while you were working on your fork or
branch. You do this by comparing incoming Changes.

→ It is good practice to make sure that there are no incoming changes
before you make your Pull Request.

If there are changes what do you do? It depends on your project
workflow. For example, if you are working on a team, your project
workflow might require you to MERGE and TEST incoming changes *before*
sending your outgoing changes back to the destination.

#### To compare your source to the destination, do the following.

1.  From the Repository with the changes, **(H1)** click  **...**  (top
    center) and **(H2)** select COMPARE  
    ![](attachments/405735527/405735627.png)  
    Bitbucket displays**(H3)** the *Compare *page.  
      
2.  Adjust the SOURCE and DESTINATION values so that they match the Pull
    Request you anticipate making.  
      
    a) Click to access**(H4)** the DIFF tab to see **(H5)** "There are
    no changes" (if there were no changes).  
    ![](attachments/405735527/405735607.png)  
      
    b) Click to access**(H6)** the COMMITS tab to see **(H7)** "There
    are no commits found" (if there were no commits)  
    ![](attachments/405735527/405735608.png)

2\. (Optional) Update the COMMIT MESSAGE with more details.

3\. (For Git repositories only) Select a MERGE STRATEGY from the two
options:

  - MERGE COMMIT - Keeps all commits from your source branch and makes
    them part of the destination branch.  
    This option is the same as entering  **`git merge --no-ff`** in the
    command line.  
      
  - SQUASH - Combines your commits when you merge the source branch into
    the destination branch.  
    This option is the same as entering  **`git merge --squash`**  in
    the command line.  
      
    *→ For more details on these two types of merge strategies, refer to
    the rest of this section.*  

4\. (Optional) If you're merging two branches in the same repository,
you can select the CLOSE SOURCE BRANCH checkbox to remove the branch
from the list of repository branches.

While merge strategies currently only apply to Git repositories, we're
planning to support them on Mercurial repositories in the future.

At the moment, clicking MERGE on a Mercurial pull request performs a
MERGE COMMIT.

</div>

</div>

Both strategies merge all your commits from your source branch to the
destination branch.

The type of strategy you chose to use depends on your team's workflow
and how you use your repository.

#### Strategy 1: When to do a Merge Commit

Select MERGE COMMIT when you want to maintain an exact history of
changes. Merge commits are also useful if, as part of your workflow,
pull requests are large in scope and you review commits
individually. Because this strategy keeps all commits during the merge,
you'll still see all commits from the source branch on the COMMITS page.

#### Strategy 2: When to do a Squash Merge

Select SQUASH to make your commits list less cluttered, which results
in less time to search for commits that introduce a bug (with a `git
bisect`) and provides an easy-to-follow commit history. Because this
strategy combines all commits when you merge, you'll only see one commit
on the destination branch on the COMMITS page.

Revert a Pull Request

</div>

<div id="expander-content-579771341" class="expand-content">

While you can't undo a pull request, you can revert the merged commit
from a pull request if necessary.

Bitbucket takes two steps to revert a pull request:

1\) Bitbucket creates a new branch with one commit that reverses the
merged commit.

2) Bitbucket creates a new pull request for the branch and commit.

  

**To Revert a Pull Request**

1.  From the pull request, click the REVERT button in the top right.

2.  (Optional) From the REVERT PULL REQUEST dialog, change the BRANCH
    NAME for the new branch you're about to create.

3.  Click the REVERT button.  
    **NOTE**:  Once you click REVERT, Bitbucket creates the new branch.
    Even if you CANCEL the pull request, the revert branch remains in
    the repository.

4.  The CREATE A PULL REQUEST page opens with the revert branch as the
    source.  
    After you add your reviewers and make additional changes, click
    CREATE.

Decline a Pull Request

</div>

<div id="expander-content-986872896" class="expand-content">

Declining a pull request is the same as saying you don't want to ever
merge the changes in that pull request in their current state.

Any reviewer can decline a pull request so your team might want to
establish a policy about when to decline verses when to leave the pull
request open in a stagnant state.

**NOTE**: Declining a pull request cannot be undone. Once you decline a
pull request you will have to open a new pull request request to
continue a review. Declining a pull request has no effect on the
branches (source or destination) so the changes in the source branch are
still in that source branch.

To decline a pull request, navigate to the Pull Request and click the
DECLINE button (top left of the page).

**To view a declined pull request**

1.  From your repository, click PULL REQUESTS (in the sidebar).
2.  At the top, select the third tab DECLINED
3.  Select the desired Declined Pull Request

The comments and tasks in a pull request are preserved after it is
declined. 

You can add more comments to a declined pull request, however, new
changes pushed to the branch will no longer update the pull request.

If this happens, Bitbucket notifies you and instructs you how to
proceed when you click MERGE.

![](attachments/405735527/405736268.png)

1.  **Source and destination:** The source repository and branch name
    points to the destination branch name.
2.  **Conflict instructions:** Use these instructions to merge locally. 

To resolve these kinds of conflicts, you pull the changes to your local
repository and resolve them there.

Manually Merge Pull Requests locally

<div id="expander-content-527328259" class="expand-content">

Sometimes, it is a good idea to use a workflow where you test a change
set on your local system before accepting a pull request.

You can do this with any pull request.

**The typical workflow is this**.

  - Receive a pull request in Bitbucket
  - Update your local repository with the incoming change set
  - Investigate and/or test the change set

→If you the change set is good, you merge it into your local repository.

You may have to resolve some conflicts. Then, you push the local
repository back to Bitbucket. Back on Bitbucket, the pull request is
marked as accepted in the PULL REQUESTS tab.

→ If you don't like the change request, you discard the changes locally
and reject the pull request on Bitbucket.

Clear and concise title

</div>

<div id="expander-content-750475006" class="expand-content">

Code reviewers will skim the title of the change to decide if they want
to review the code and if so, when. So let's make this easy for them.

**Keep the title short, but expressive enough to signal what the
reviewer can expect.**Let's say you're working on an accounting software
and there is a new business requirement on how to calculate tax for
Switzerland. A title like`Changes for Swiss tax calculation`is concise.
A title like`Change for tax calculation in Switzerland for new
regulation`is still concise, with more context. However, a title
like`Adding new tax parameters`or`Change tax logic`are overly generic
and won't help reviewers give an idea of the type of change. This will
make it difficult for them to decide if they should review the change.
What about titles like`TaxInternals structure update and
CalculateEffectiveRate changes in case of Swiss country code` or `Change
tax calculation for Swiss businesses in the TX bracket effective
from 2019 following new regulation`? These are on the other end of the
spectrum: they are verbose and feel they provide like too much detail in
the title. What is too little and what is too much information will
depend on your environment: try to strike the right balance.

As the team grows, it can make sense to agree on conventions to make
titles easy to compare. One practice, for example, that my team have
adopted is starting the title with uppercase and the first word being a
verb in present tense. So we prefer`Change Swiss tax calculation for new
regulation`over`changed Swiss tax calculation for new
regulation` or `Ability to calculate Swiss tax for new regulation`.
This kind of suggestion can be a nice touch for consistency across code
reviews or onboarding new people - but all of it will be specific to
your team or company.

The "why" of the change

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1430324588" class="expand-content">

People reviewing the code spend a lot less time thinking about the
change as the author. Providing the context in the description of the
change request helps them up to speed on the reasoning behind the code
changes.

**Having a clear "why" section will make the code easier to review for
people for everyone.**For people with plenty of domain knowledge, it
serves as a quick validation and they will verify if you follow what you
set out to. For people with less domain knowledge - such as recent team
members or people not familiar with the codebase - it will allow to do a
decent review. Having people who are not that familiar with the codebase
can both bring in a new perspective and it is also an efficient way to
share knowledge.

For teams using project management tools, on top of a short and clear
description, linking to the tracking task is helpful. The task often has
a lot more context, often conversations and can help the curious
reviewer dig deeper and catch up on context. The same goes for linking
other resources that can help understand the "why" deeper, such as
design documents.

Visual support

<div id="expander-content-2019602566" class="expand-content">

For client-side changes, such as those on the web or mobile, few things
make a review easier than attaching "before" and "after" screenshots -
gifs or video recordings for changes on animations.

This is a practice that not only helps the reviewers greatly, but also
the author, who does another verification when creating the pull
request. For changes impacting the UI, without this visual aid, thorough
reviewers would have to grab the changes, build the product and run it
in their local environment to visualize the changes.

My team came up with code review request best practices that we
circulated, reviewed and committed to and now use it to onboard new
members. This was a good exercise to decide what things we cared about,
as a team, and to turn best practices into*our*practices.

One thing that worked especially well was having a list of a few,
internal examples of code review requests that were deemed easy to
review. Good code review requests come in different shapes and sizes.
Having best practices helps set team-level expectations. Good

Pull Request

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

*Pull requests are an effective way to perform code review and
collaboration in a positive way in the team.*

## Pull requests offer

  - Complete diff (difference) of the changes to each file.
  - Automatic updates so you can see changes as they are made
  - Inline comments so you can pinpoint change suggestions
  - Tasks to help you keep track of what changes need attention
  - Notifications for comments, commits, or approvals
  - Two merge strategy options for Git repositories

Build better Pull Requests

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1651718544" class="expand-content">

Here are a few suggestions to make PULL REQUESTS more effective.

  - Try to make the pull request small enough to review but large enough
    to give you the context of the feature, bug fix, or update
  - Use @mentions  and in-line comments to guide specific reviewers to
    specific items in the code
  - Ask reviewers to create TASKS for things which must be addressed for
    APPROVAL. This helps designate between suggestions and discussions
    and things which must be fixed
  - An accurate description and links to any issues gives reviewers more
    context and better access to what they need to understand the
    problem or feature you're addressing

<div id="expander-content-1413661048" class="expand-content">

Before creating a Pull Request, you should compare your outgoing
Requests to the destination Repository.This tells you how much the
destination Repository changed while you were working on your fork or
branch. You do this by comparing incoming Changes.

→ It is good practice to make sure that there are no incoming changes
before you make your Pull Request.

If there are changes what do you do? It depends on your project
workflow. For example, if you are working on a team, your project
workflow might require you to MERGE and TEST incoming changes *before*
sending your outgoing changes back to the destination.

#### To compare your source to the destination, do the following.

1.  From the Repository with the changes, **(H1)** click  **...**  (top
    center) and **(H2)** select COMPARE  
    ![](attachments/405735527/405735627.png)  
    Bitbucket displays**(H3)** the *Compare *page.  
      
2.  Adjust the SOURCE and DESTINATION values so that they match the Pull
    Request you anticipate making.  
      
    a) Click to access**(H4)** the DIFF tab to see **(H5)** "There are

While merge strategies currently only apply to Git repositories, we're
planning to support them on Mercurial repositories in the future.

At the moment, clicking MERGE on a Mercurial pull request performs a
MERGE COMMIT.

</div>

</div>

Both strategies merge all your commits from your source branch to the
destination branch.

The type of strategy you chose to use depends on your team's workflow
and how you use your repository.

#### Strategy 1: When to do a Merge Commit

Select MERGE COMMIT when you want to maintain an exact history of
changes. Merge commits are also useful if, as part of your workflow,
pull requests are large in scope and you review commits
individually. Because this strategy keeps all commits during the merge,
you'll still see all commits from the source branch on the COMMITS page.

#### Strategy 2: When to do a Squash Merge

Select SQUASH to make your commits list less cluttered, which results
in less time to search for commits that introduce a bug (with a `git
bisect`) and provides an easy-to-follow commit history. Because this
strategy combines all commits when you merge, you'll only see one commit
on the destination branch on the COMMITS page.

While you can't undo a pull request, you can revert the merged commit
from a pull request if necessary.

Bitbucket takes two steps to revert a pull request:

1\) Bitbucket creates a new branch with one commit that reverses the
merged commit.

2) Bitbucket creates a new pull request for the branch and commit.

  

**To Revert a Pull Request**

1.  From the pull request, click the REVERT button in the top right.

2.  (Optional) From the REVERT PULL REQUEST dialog, change the BRANCH
    NAME for the new branch you're about to create.

3.  Click the REVERT button.  
    **NOTE**:  Once you click REVERT, Bitbucket creates the new branch.
    Even if you CANCEL the pull request, the revert branch remains in
    the repository.

4.  The CREATE A PULL REQUEST page opens with the revert branch as the
    source.  
    After you add your reviewers and make additional changes, click
    CREATE.

Decline a Pull Request

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1799598723" class="expand-content">

Declining a pull request is the same as saying you don't want to ever
merge the changes in that pull request in their current state.

Any reviewer can decline a pull request so your team might want to
establish a policy about when to decline verses when to leave the pull
request open in a stagnant state.

**NOTE**: Declining a pull request cannot be undone. Once you decline a
pull request you will have to open a new pull request request to
continue a review. Declining a pull request has no effect on the
branches (source or destination) so the changes in the source branch are
still in that source branch.

To decline a pull request, navigate to the Pull Request and click the
DECLINE button (top left of the page).

**To view a declined pull request**

1.  From your repository, click PULL REQUESTS (in the sidebar).
2.  At the top, select the third tab DECLINED
3.  Select the desired Declined Pull Request

The comments and tasks in a pull request are preserved after it is
declined. 

You can add more comments to a declined pull request, however, new
changes pushed to the branch will no longer update the pull request.

Resolve a Pull Request with Conflicts

<div id="expander-content-893082991" class="expand-content">

When it detects Conflicts in a pull request's incoming code, Bitbucket
cannot automatically Accept and Merge.

If this happens, Bitbucket notifies you and instructs you how to
proceed when you click MERGE.

![](attachments/405735527/405736268.png)

1.  **Source and destination:** The source repository and branch name
    points to the destination branch name.
2.  **Conflict instructions:** Use these instructions to merge locally. 

To resolve these kinds of conflicts, you pull the changes to your local
repository and resolve them there.

Manually Merge Pull Requests locally

</div>

<div id="expander-content-858332292" class="expand-content">

Sometimes, it is a good idea to use a workflow where you test a change
set on your local system before accepting a pull request.

You can do this with any pull request.

**The typical workflow is this**.

  - Receive a pull request in Bitbucket
  - Update your local repository with the incoming change set
  - Investigate and/or test the change set

→If you the change set is good, you merge it into your local repository.

You may have to resolve some conflicts. Then, you push the local
repository back to Bitbucket. Back on Bitbucket, the pull request is
marked as accepted in the PULL REQUESTS tab.

→ If you don't like the change request, you discard the changes locally
and reject the pull request on Bitbucket.

Clear and concise title

</div>

<div id="expander-content-856633167" class="expand-content">

Code reviewers will skim the title of the change to decide if they want
to review the code and if so, when. So let's make this easy for them.

**Keep the title short, but expressive enough to signal what the
reviewer can expect.**Let's say you're working on an accounting software
and there is a new business requirement on how to calculate tax for
Switzerland. A title like`Changes for Swiss tax calculation`is concise.
A title like`Change for tax calculation in Switzerland for new
regulation`is still concise, with more context. However, a title
like`Adding new tax parameters`or`Change tax logic`are overly generic
and won't help reviewers give an idea of the type of change. This will
make it difficult for them to decide if they should review the change.
What about titles like`TaxInternals structure update and
CalculateEffectiveRate changes in case of Swiss country code` or `Change
tax calculation for Swiss businesses in the TX bracket effective
from 2019 following new regulation`? These are on the other end of the
spectrum: they are verbose and feel they provide like too much detail in
the title. What is too little and what is too much information will
depend on your environment: try to strike the right balance.

As the team grows, it can make sense to agree on conventions to make
titles easy to compare. One practice, for example, that my team have
adopted is starting the title with uppercase and the first word being a
verb in present tense. So we prefer`Change Swiss tax calculation for new
regulation`over`changed Swiss tax calculation for new
regulation` or `Ability to calculate Swiss tax for new regulation`.
This kind of suggestion can be a nice touch for consistency across code
reviews or onboarding new people - but all of it will be specific to
your team or company.

The "why" of the change

</div>

<div id="expander-content-910085780" class="expand-content">

People reviewing the code spend a lot less time thinking about the
change as the author. Providing the context in the description of the
change request helps them up to speed on the reasoning behind the code
changes.

**Having a clear "why" section will make the code easier to review for
people for everyone.**For people with plenty of domain knowledge, it
serves as a quick validation and they will verify if you follow what you
set out to. For people with less domain knowledge - such as recent team
members or people not familiar with the codebase - it will allow to do a
decent review. Having people who are not that familiar with the codebase
can both bring in a new perspective and it is also an efficient way to
share knowledge.

For teams using project management tools, on top of a short and clear
description, linking to the tracking task is helpful. The task often has
a lot more context, often conversations and can help the curious
reviewer dig deeper and catch up on context. The same goes for linking
other resources that can help understand the "why" deeper, such as
design documents.

Visual support

<div id="expander-content-620176215" class="expand-content">

For client-side changes, such as those on the web or mobile, few things
make a review easier than attaching "before" and "after" screenshots -
gifs or video recordings for changes on animations.

This is a practice that not only helps the reviewers greatly, but also
the author, who does another verification when creating the pull
request. For changes impacting the UI, without this visual aid, thorough
reviewers would have to grab the changes, build the product and run it
in their local environment to visualize the changes.

My team came up with code review request best practices that we
circulated, reviewed and committed to and now use it to onboard new
members. This was a good exercise to decide what things we cared about,
as a team, and to turn best practices into*our*practices.

One thing that worked especially well was having a list of a few,
internal examples of code review requests that were deemed easy to
review. Good code review requests come in different shapes and sizes.
Having best practices helps set team-level expectations. Good

The .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders
to ignore in a project.  
A local .gitignore file is usually placed in the root directory of a
project. You can also create a global .gitignore file and any entries in
that file will be ignored in all of your Git repositories.  
To create a local .gitignore file, create a text file and name it
.gitignore (remember to include the . at the beginning). Then edit this
file as needed. Each new line should list an additional file or folder
that you want Git to ignore.  
The entries in this file can also follow a matching pattern.

  - `*` is used as a wildcard match
  - `/` is used to ignore pathnames relative to the .gitignore file
  - `#` is used to add comments to a .gitignore file

Transfering Git Database

<div id="expander-content-1108024981" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

Git is nowadays the*de fact*o standard in version control, distributed
or not. It comes with a vast array of powerful features, some of them go
unnoticed by the majority of its casual users. One such feature is Git’s
capability to connect your local repository with multiple remote
repositories, as well as removing and adding remote locations as you
wish.

  

<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Git Remotes**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

In contrast to older version control tools, such as CVS and SVN, where
all code was centralised in a single repository, Git allows code to
co-exist in an unlimited number of remote repositories.In fact, the mere
notion of the original, central, or “origin”, repository in Git is just
a convention. It just*happens*to be the repository most users started
synchronising with when they did that initial`git clone`. As the project
progresses repository location and preferences may change, so what was
once, in the beginning, the*origin*may start to seem irrelevant:

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Transferring Method**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

We’ve established so far that you can have as many remotes as you wish
and that their name doesn’t have any significant role in Git’s
ecosystem. So, how can we leverage this feature of Git to transfer files
from one remote to another?

## Losing all history (developer-god mode)

The quick and dirty way is to just clone the new, empty repository,
copy/paste the files from the source repository, and commit/push.
Although that approach might save you a few minutes and doesn’t require
any other than the standard Git commands you already know, it comes with
a severe drawback.Since you are the one committing all the files to the
new repository, you are now becoming the sole author of every single
file of the source repository. Any previous commit history, kept in the
source repository, is now lost forever and the whole project looks like
it has been created by a single person (you).Developer-god syndrome
satisfied; original authors pissed off.

## Keeping history

Copying resources from one repository to another while keeping commit
history intact not only acknowledges everybody else’s original work but
might come with useful perks. For example, you can search previous
commit messages to find an explication that sheds light into an issue
you’re investigating; if you realise a specific developer is prone to
the same type of mistakes, you can easily filter out his/her commits to
re-check them, and many more.

<div id="expander-1014930056" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1014930056" class="expand-control">

Transfer Commands

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1014930056" class="expand-content">

If you search for how to transfer a Git repository you’ll end up with
several different suggestions, ranging from simple sequences of Git
commands to pure Git black magic.

The approach suggested next may not necessarily be “the best out there”,
however, it has been tested on repositories with thousands of commits
and is honouring two basic principles: 1/ Keeping the complete commit
history including all branches and tags, and 2/ not interfering with the
original repository.

So, let’s start with the commands.

## Start by creating a mirrored clone of your old repository

> git clone --mirror old-repo-url new-repo

Replace`old-repo-url`with the Git URL of your old repo and give an
appropriate name to the`new-repo`folder on which it will be cloned.

## Remove the remote reference to the original/old repository

> cd new-repo  
> git remote remove origin

You may get a warning if your original repository contains branches but
you can ignore it. Technically speaking, this step is not necessary
since as discussed above you can have multiple remotes, however, it
makes future commands a bit simpler to type and completely detaches you
from the original repository.

## Add the remote reference for the new repository

> git remote add origin new-repo-url

Replace`new-repo-url`with the Git URL of your new repository. It goes
without saying that you should have had the new repo created beforehand
in your favourite Git management system.

## Push everything to the new repository

> git push --all  
> git push --tags

## Clone the new repository

> cd ..  
> rm -rf new-repo  
> git clone new-repo-url new-repo

Replace`new-repo-url`and`new-repo`with your new repository.

This last step is necessary because the clone performed in step (1) was
a mirrored clone that can’t be used as such for further commits. Let me
know in the comments if you’re aware of a way to convert it, effectively
bypassing this re-cloning step.

Production-ready software requires testing before it goes into
production. As the discipline of software development matured, software
testing approaches have matured too. Instead of having myriads of manual
software testers, development teams have moved towards automating the
biggest portion of their testing efforts. Automating their tests allows
teams to know whether their software is broken in a matter of seconds
and minutes instead of days and weeks.

The drastically shortened feedback loop fuelled by automated tests goes
hand in hand with agile development practices, continuous delivery and
DevOps culture. Having an effective software testing approach allows
teams to move fast and with confidence.

**Importance of Test Automation**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

Software has become an essential part of the world we live in. It has
outgrown its early sole purpose of making businesses more efficient.
Today companies try to find ways to become first-class digital
companies. As users everyone of us interacts with an ever-increasing
amount of software every day. The wheels of innovation are turning
faster.

If you want to keep pace you'll have to look into ways to deliver your
software faster without sacrificing its quality.**Continuous delivery**,
a practice where you automatically ensure that your software can be
released into production any time, can help you with that. With
continuous delivery you use a**build pipeline**to automatically test
your software and deploy it to your testing and production environments.

Building, testing and deploying an ever-increasing amount of software
manually soon becomes impossible — unless you want to spend all your
time with manual, repetitive work instead of delivering working
software. Automating everything — from build to tests, deployment and
infrastructure — is your only way forward.

![](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid/buildPipeline.png)

Figure 1: Use build pipelines to automatically and reliably get your
software into production

Traditionally software testing was overly manual work done by deploying
your application to a test environment and then performing some
black-box style testing e.g. by clicking through your user interface to
see if anything's broken. Often these tests would be specified by test
scripts to ensure the testers would do consistent checking.

It's obvious that testing all changes manually is time-consuming,
repetitive and tedious. Repetitive is boring, boring leads to mistakes
and makes you look for a different job by the end of the week.

Luckily there's a remedy for repetitive tasks:*automation*.

Automating your repetitive tests can be a big game changer in your life
as a software developer. Automate these tests and you no longer have to
mindlessly follow click protocols in order to check if your software
still works correctly. Automate your tests and you can change your
codebase without batting an eye. If you've ever tried doing a
large-scale refactoring without a proper test suite I bet you know what
a terrifying experience this can be. How would you know if you
accidentally broke stuff along the way? Well, you click through all your
manual test cases, that's how. But let's be honest: do you really enjoy
that? How about making even large-scale changes and knowing whether you
broke stuff within seconds while taking a nice sip of coffee? Sounds
more enjoyable if you ask me.

  

The figure shows the initial time & efforts it takes in learning the
best practices of test automation. But we can see how it saves the
overall effort and time spent.

**Test Pyramid**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

Test Pyramid is a great visual metaphor telling you to think about
different layers of testing. It also tells you how much testing to do on
each layer.

Stick to the pyramid shape to come up with a healthy, fast and
maintainable test suite: Write*lots*of small and fast*unit tests*.
Write*some*more coarse-grained tests and*very few*high-level tests that
test your application from end to end. Watch out that you don't end up
with a[test ice-cream
cone](https://watirmelon.blog/testing-pyramids/)that will be a nightmare
to maintain and takes way too long to run.

Don't become too attached to the names of the individual layers in
Cohn's test pyramid. In fact they can be quite misleading:*service
test*is a term that is hard to grasp (Cohn himself talks about the
observation that[a lot of developers completely ignore this
layer](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-forgotten-layer-of-the-test-automation-pyramid)).
In the days of single page application frameworks like react, angular,
ember.js and others it becomes apparent that*UI tests*don't have to be
on the highest level of your pyramid - you're perfectly able to unit
test your UI in all of these frameworks.

**Legends**

  - Colors: does not have any meaning
  - The size of the diamond face represents the test coverage in each
    phase
  - On the left, there is a hypothesis of test type (change it to fit
    needs)
  - Some other type of test like performance, stability, soak, code
    validation, security investigations, infrastructure checks, … should
    be added.

Automated Test should cover mostly critical functionalities (for example
the Order Flow, the Customer Care channels, the delivery process, ….)
and must cover deep investigations on the visible User interface and in
the invisible backend systems, databases, virtual environments,
integration with external systems, …

It is not an easy job\! It cannot be done only by a traditional test
gate.

Confidence in testing can be eroded by doubts: are we testing the right
things, are a test-set at the proper coverage, are the integration tests
executes in production-like setup, and so on. As mitigation we can:

  - At the Planning phase, decide which is the minimum set of test that
    has to be passed to declare the work done and ready for the next
    stage.
  - During each DevOps stage to look at the set of test and fill any gap
    or modify test things
  - At the Release stage (if using the Release on-demand) someone has
    the duty to approve the Deployment. He/She need a clear and
    synthetic view of the test results. So, taking track of all the
    testing results is crucial.
  - Reporting of historical results and their comparisons help in
    improvements
  - Learn from Production exceptions
  - On some stages, it is crucial to simulate some behavior (an
    integrated service is not available, not ready, unstable, under
    maintenance or not reachable), a service virtualization solution
    should help in doing things faster and with confidence. My thoughts
    are here…

Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automating the build and
testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version
control. CI encourages developers to share their code and unit tests by
merging their changes into a shared version control repository after
every small task completion. Committing code triggers an automated build
system to grab the latest code from the shared repository and to build,
test, and validate the full master branch (also known as the trunk or
main).

CI emerged as a best practice because software developers often work in
isolation, and then they need to integrate their changes with the rest
of the team’s code base. Waiting days or weeks to integrate code creates
many merge conflicts, hard to fix bugs, diverging code strategies, and
duplicated efforts. CI requires the development team’s code be merged to
a shared version control branch continuously to avoid these problems.

CI keeps the master branch clean. Teams can leverage modern version
control systems such as Git to create short-lived feature branches to
isolate their work. A developer submits a “pull request” when the
feature is complete and, on approval of the pull request, the changes
get merged into the master branch. Then the developer can delete the
previous feature branch. Development teams repeat the process for
additional work. The team can establish branch policies to ensure the
master branch meets desired quality criteria.

Teams use build definitions to ensure that every commit to the master
branch triggers the automated build and testing processes. Implementing
CI this way ensures bugs are caught earlier in the development cycle,
which makes them less expensive to fix. Automated tests run for every
build to ensure builds maintain a consistent quality.

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

Continuous Delivery (CD) is the process to build, test, configure and
deploy from a build to a production environment. Multiple testing or
staging environments create a *Release Pipeline* to automate the
creation of infrastructure and deployment of a new. Successive
environments support progressively longer-running activities of
integration, load, and user acceptance testing. Continuous Integration
starts the CD process and the pipeline stages each successive
environment the next upon successful completion of tests.

Continuous Delivery may sequence multiple deployment “rings” for
progressive exposure (also known as “controlling the blast radius”).
Progressive exposure groups users who get to try new releases to monitor
their experience in “rings.” The first deployment ring is often a
“canary” used to test new versions in production before a broader
rollout. CD automates deployment from one ring to the next and may
optionally depend on an approval step, in which a decision maker signs
off on the changes electronically. CD may create an auditable record of
the approval in order to satisfy regulatory procedures or other control
objectives.

Without Continuous Delivery, software release cycles were previously a
bottleneck for application and operation teams. Manual processes led to
unreliable releases that produced delays and errors. These teams often
relied on handoffs that resulted in issues during release cycles. The
automated release pipeline allows a “fail fast” approach to validation,
where the tests most likely to fail quickly are run first and
longer-running tests happen after the faster ones complete successfully.

Continuous Delivery is a lean practice. The goal of CD is to keep
production fresh by achieving the shortest path from the availability of
new code in version control or new components in package management to
deployment. By automation, CD minimizes the time to deploy and *time to
mitigate* or *time to remediate* production incidents (TTM and TTR). In
lean terms, this optimizes process time and eliminates idle time.
Continuous Delivery is helped considerably by the complementary
practices of [Infrastructure as
Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) and
[Monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/what-is-monitoring).

Continuous Delivery also supports two other patterns for progressive
exposure beside sequential rings. “Blue/Green deployment” relies on
keeping an existing (blue) version live while a new (green) one is
deployed. Typically, this uses load balancing to direct increasing
amounts of traffic to the green deployment. If monitoring discovers an
incident, traffic can be rerouted to the blue deployment still running.
“Feature flags” (or “feature toggles”) comprise another technique used
for experimentation and “dark launches.” Feature flags turn on features
on or off for different end users based on their identity and group
membership.

### Project Level

In theory most there should not be that many variables at this level.
Just overriding Global or Team Level if done correctly.

Example: Any projects under ITDev - Test Automation.

Role in DevOps

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

  

In order to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.
DevOps introduce some set of practice that automates the processes
between software development and IT teams.

DevOps aimed not only to improve the process of feature releases but
also to reduce defects, so that products can gain high level of quality.
DevOps reduce the process cost related with delivering working product
in incremental approach. DevOps dealing with small, rapid, iterative
development.

The changes that each release having clarity, consistency and
collaboration to understand each other. Changes also been affected in
production environment and customer environment. QA team design details
test plan based on those changes. Operation and development team need to
come on same umbrella. This time specified methodology and tools play a
vital role. Each team following their own designed methodology that best
suit with their skill and process. But goals are common. That is quality
products in a very short time.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3483/1*BZUIwLExSu3slCz5mu_ETw.png)

Testers and developers both play important roles in DevOps.

Normally test Process are based on some steps that following all test
levels until product ready for final deployment. Consider those
activities that describe below.

  - a. QA team gets build after it successfully deployed. Here planed
    test environment is the key factor that influence test.
  - b. Then QA team perform test execution based on pre planed test case
    or without defined test cases.
  - c. Test execution may be Manual or Automated.
  - d. Functional and Regression testing are main concern.
  - After QA team meets exit criteria then they stopped testing. Then
    this build finally goes into the production server.

Now think about**DevOps**. In DevOps, test scenario is different from
traditional test process. As quickly as possible QA transfer fresh
development code into the production environment with the collaboration
of the DevOps teams. DevOps engineer then provide the necessary support
on tools and infrastructure to make it a process that works perfectly,
making sure all changes function behaved as expected.

QA team should be focused about quality in software development
life-cycle. Testers be part of technical teams. Testers have to consider
manual functional and non-functional testing, and should focus on their
skills and experiences for apply test automation, and define test
strategies.

Testers always think about requirements that must be meet. Testers be
focused on every change and their effect on developing products. In
order to do this, requirements analysis done by testers. Testers find
out test scope. After successfully analysis, quality attributes be
well-introduce. Some quality characteristic be pre-defined by
organizations or by customers. Requirements need to be specific. QA
teams should involve in the requirements process to help and guide
development teams. QA teams need to start thinking about how they can
utilize their skills to add value as more of their day-to-day work is
automated.

Risk based testing also have large benefits. Testers have to do
regression testing when major changes that may affect other functions as
well. In this scenario automate regression test play very important role
by maximum test coverage.

QA teams should play positive attitude and try most effective
communication way with teams so their technique can add the value by all
possible way in the software development life cycle.

As a tester, the following core tasks need to be maintained through the
life cycle.

  - Engineers and QA activities should be one lined based on standard
    that expected.
  - Try to automate test cases.
  - All deployment must be automated.
  - Test cases that are automated should be perfectly aligned with the
    Continuous Integration cycle.
  - Proper utilization of test automation tools and Continuous
    Integration tools.

From a logistical perspective, Ernest Mueller, lean systems manager for
AlienVault and organizer of DevOps Days Austin says, there are three
likely ways to see QA roles reassigned to better fit DevOps
organizations.

First, there’s the opportunity to embed QA expertise directly within
product teams to directly support them. This is an area that has been
most effective in dealing with QA transition so far, says Steve
Anderson, CEO of the DevOps and agile consultancy Clutch. “The most
successful ways I’ve seen where you still get a hybrid going on is where
a QA is directly embedded into the sprint team or the scrum team, where
they’re involved from the get-go,” he says. “They get the user’s story.
They’re writing test cases.”

Second, Mueller says, there’s also the potential for diverting QA pros
into tooling groups responsible for writing the test harness or
providing tooling across the organization.

And third, there’s the opportunity for creating a center of excellence
or consulting group meant to advise specific work groups on strategic
issues of quality. “That can be tricky, because having the separate
consulting group can easily turn into doing it the way you used to
work,” he explains. “It’s a very subtle approach change that you have
to make. It’s not like they’re not doing work for you. They’re providing
expert consulting so you can do the work better.”

The speed of automation should have QA working within a totally
different paradigm, says Wayne Ariola, chief strategy officer for
Parasoft, a testing and service virtualization firm. “Today we’re mostly
in causal observation mode: Build the test, experience the defect,
collect the defect — it’s causal. Something happened, we collected it,”
he says. “We need to move to a more probabilistic mode.

“This means getting to know the internal application much more as
testers than we do today,” he says. “This also means we have to
understand the dependencies associated with the operational testing.”

The truth is that there is still plenty of room for testing
professionals in the era of DevOps. They just need to adapt to a
rewritten organizational hierarchy — and a completely different mindset
about testing objectives.

For maintain higher accuracy on quality, it is necessary to automate all
testing processes by accurately configuring for auto deployment. QA team
should Keep in their mind that all process should be done without any
failure.

Concentrating on the customer needs, tester give focus on validating
product in short time and gaining high level of quality. A good tester
should not mess with time and quality when more builds are on pipeline.

### Categories Test Cases

Each code base has different ways to group the test cases. 

Categorizing test cases we can have utilize one project for all the
environment destination as well as reusing same test case for different
environments.

#### Test Categories

1.  FunctionalTest
2.  SmokeTest
3.  SanityCheck
4.  RegressionTest - Do not need to specify this test category.
    Automation Server will execute all test cases ignoring Test Category
    grouping.

### Script Modules to Include (within the Process tab)

  - ExecuteReadyAPI - Script Module - All Can Use or ExecuteSelenium -
    Script Module - All Can use
  - SendEmails - Script Module - All can use

### Variables

Add these Library Variable Sets

  - Common Variables - Global Variables
  - Customer - Global Variables
  - Test Automation

### Channels

Channel name Automation (Same value as Team City OctopusChannel)

LifeCycle - should be inheriting from project.  Project Lifecycle should

#### Script Modules

There is a generic PowerShell script to execute and send emails to the
designated group when any test case fails. Scripts are maintain and
deployed to Octopus by [Test Automation
Configuration](Test-Automation-Configuration_451824120.html). Everyone
should be using the same generic script - do not create duplicate or
many any changes within Octopus. It will be replace on a regular basis.
Duplication of any sort will be removed.

ExecuteReadyAPI - Script Module - All Can Use is for SoapUI

ExecuteSelenium - Script Module - All Can Use is for Selenium

#### Variable Sets

There is a central library variable call Test Automation. This where all
designated groups will be declared, NOT within the Octopus project
process step.

## Multipart Names

Unless specified otherwise, all Transact-SQL references to the name of a
database object can be a four-part name in the following form:

*server\_name*.\[*database\_name*\].\[*schema\_name*\].*object\_name*

|*database\_name*.\[*schema\_name*\].*object\_name*

|*schema\_name*.*object\_name*

|*object\_name*

*server\_name*  
Specifies a linked server name or remote server name.

*database\_name*  
Specifies the name of a SQL Server database when the object resides in a
local instance of SQL Server. When the object is in a linked
server,*database\_name*specifies an OLE DB catalog.

*schema\_name*  
Specifies the name of the schema that contains the object if the object
is in a SQL Server database. When the object is in a linked
server,*schema\_name*specifies an OLE DB schema name.

*object\_name*  
Refers to the name of the object.

When referencing a specific object, you don't always have to specify the
server, database, and schema for the SQL Server Database Engine to
identify the object. However, if the object can't be found, an error is
returned.

**Relational Database**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

A***relational database***is a set of formally described tables
(*lists*in our example) from which***data***can be accessed or
reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize
the***database***tables. There are many different types of relational
databases — lined paper, sadly, not being one of them\!

A hallmark feature of the most popular relational databases is a query
language called SQL (Standard Query Language). Meaning that, if Grandma
upgrades her remembering system to a computer, she’d be able to quickly
answer questions like, “Who hasn’t visited me in the last year, is
married, and doesn’t have any hobbies?”

Among the world’s most popular choices for a SQL Database Management
System is MySQL, which is open-source. It is implemented primarily as a
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for web-based software
applications.

Some key features of MySQL include:

  - It’s really well known, commonly used, and thoroughly tested.
  - There’s a lot of qualified developers experienced in SQL and
    relational databases.
  - Data gets stored in various tables, allowing easy relations using
    primary and foreign keys (fancy speak for*id*s).
  - It’s easy to use and performant, making it ideal for big and small
    businesses.
  - The source code is under the GNU General Public License agreement.

**No SQL**

</div>

<div class="panelContent">

Many **NoSQL **(“not only” SQL)** databases** exist. In our examples, we
exemplified a *Document database. *NoSQL databases model data in ways
that exclude the tabular relations provided in relational databases.
These databases became popular in the early 2000s amongst companies that
required cloud-based database clustering due to their sheer scaling
requirements (i.e. Facebook). In such applications, having data
consistency was a lot less important than performance and scalability.

In the early days, NoSQL databases often got used for super focused data
management tasks. Mainly when it came to web and cloud apps, NoSQL DB’s
have been proven to process and distribute significant volumes of data.
Engineers building with NoSQL have also liked the flexible data schema
(or complete lack thereof), so that fast changes to apps being updated
often were possible.

The key features of NoSQL include:

  - A highly flexible way of persisting data
  - Horizontal scaling to clusters
  - Eventual consistency on persistence/propagation
  - Documents that are identified using unique keys

The huge data set has introduced the challenges of data storage, data
management, data analysis, etc. Moreover, it becomes semi-structured and
sparse. In the case of RDBMS, there is a need for upfront schema and
relational references.

To resolve these problems related to semi-structured or unstructured
data, a range of new database products has emerged during the last few
years. The new class of database products consists of column-based data
stores, key-value pair databases, and document databases, etc. When used
together, these databases are called NoSQL consist of diverse products
each having a unique set of features and propositions.

Other than this, NoSQL databases can be scaled out easily when compared
to SQL databases. The load is distributed among multiple hosts as shown
below whenever load increases.

## Features of NoSQL database

### Non-Relational

  - NoSQL databases never follow the relational database models.
  - It never provides a table with fixed column records.
  - It works with self-contained aggregates.
  - It does not require any data normalization or object-relational
    mapping.
  - There are no complex features like relational databases.

### Distributed Computing

  - It is possible to execute multiple databases in a distributed
    manner.
  - It offers fail-over capabilities and auto-scaling features.
  - It can be used with all programming language, or there is no
    standard query to use with NoSQL databases.
  - It provides eventual consistency.
  - It provides no synchronous replication among distributed nodes.
  - It enables maximum distribution and less coordination among data
    nodes.

![Distributed
Computing](https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/uploads/images/2019/04/3-2.png)

### Schema-Free

  - NoSQL databases either have relaxed schemas or it is schema-free.
  - It does not require any definition for the schema of the data.
  - It offers heterogeneous data structures for the same domains.

![Schema-Free](https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/uploads/images/2019/04/4-2.png)

### Simple API

  - It offers easy to use interface for data storage and data query.
  - It allows low-level selection methods and low-level data
    manipulation.
  - It uses text-based protocols with HTTP and JSON.
  - It has no standard-based query language.
  - It is a web-enabled database running as internet-facing services.

## NoSQL Database Types you should know

![NoSQL Database Types you should
know](https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/uploads/images/2019/04/5-2.png)

There are four classes of NoSQL databases with their unique attributes
and limitations. You should understand each of them in depth first and
choose the best one that suits your requirements the most. Let us see
each of them one by one.

### Key-value pair based

This database is designed to manage heavy loads and a lot of data
gracefully. It stores data in key-value pairs where each key is unique
and value can be anything like object, string JSON, etc. Here is one
quick example of the database given below.

![NoSQL Database Types
](https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/uploads/images/2019/04/6-1.png)

It is the most basic type of database that can be used as collections,
arrays, dictionaries, etc. It helps developers to store the schema-less
data. It works best for shopping cart content.

### Column-based NoSQL Database

This database is column-oriented where each column is treated
separately, and values are stored contiguously. Here is the simple
example of how column-based NoSQL database looks like:

![NoSQL Database Types
](https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/uploads/images/2019/04/7-1.png)

It works best for aggregation queries like SUM, Count, MAX, MIN, AVG,
etc. It helps to find data quickly in columns. This database is majorly
used for managing catalogs, data warehouse, BI projects, CRM, or
library, etc.

### Document-Oriented NoSQL Database

It stores and retrieves the data as key-value pair, but the value is
stored in documents in XML or JSON formats. A database itself
understands or queries the data. In the diagram, you can see a table
where data is stored in row and column format. And the right-hand side
is covered by documents where data is stored in JSON format. Here, you
don’t have to define columns which makes it more flexible as compared to
relational databases.

![Document-Oriented NoSQL
Database](https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/uploads/images/2019/04/8-1.png)

It is mostly used for blogging platforms, CRM systems, or real-time
analytics, etc. it is used for complex transactions that require
multiple operations against varying aggregate functions.

## Graph-based NoSQL Databases

![Graph-based NoSQL
Databases](https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/uploads/images/2019/04/9-1.png)

This database stores the entity and defines the relationship among
different entities. The stored entity is named as the node, and the
relationship is defined as the edge. Each node and edge must have a
unique identifier. Here, tables are multi-relational in nature, not
loosely connected. Traversing relationship is much faster in NoSQL
databases when compared to relational databases. It is mostly used for
logistics, networks, and spatial data.

### Query Mechanism tools for NoSQL Database

The data retrieval mechanism in NoSQL database is REST-based  the value
is retrieved based on key/ID with the GET resource. Document stores the
most difficult queries as they use the key-value pair to store the data.
For example, Couch DB define views with the MapReduce.

### What is the CAP Theorem?

This theorem is given by the Brewer which states that it is not possible
for distributed data stores to give more than two out of total three
guarantees. These are consistency, partition tolerance, and
availability.

1). Consistency:

The data should remain consistent even after the execution of an
operation, it means once data is written, any future read request should
be able to access the same data. For example, once you update the status
of an order, the client should be able to check the same data.

2). Partition Tolerance:

If communication among servers is not stable even then the system should
be able to work properly, it is called the partition tolerance. For
example, when the server is divided into multiple partitions, they may
or may not communicate together. If one part of the database is
unavailable even then other parts should not be affected.

3). Availability:

The database should be highly responsive and available without any
downtime.

### Eventual Consistency

The term eventual consistency means multiple data copies are available
on different machines to get higher availability and scalability. If
some changes are made to one file, it should automatically be reflected
other replicas.

Data replication is not instantaneous because a few copies are updated
frequently and a few over time. But you have to make sure content is the
same for all replicas. Hence, the name of this phenomenon is given as
eventual consistency.

BASE: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency

![Graph-based NoSQL
Databases](https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/uploads/images/2019/04/10-1.png)

  - Here basically available means DB is available all the time as per
    the assumption of CAP theorem.
  - Soft state means the state of a system may change without an input.
  - Eventual consistency means system become consistent over time.

### Advantages of NoSQL Database

The desired technical characteristics for NoSQL database are given as
below.

#### Primary and Analytic Data Source Capability

The first criteria for any NoSQL solution are that it must serve as the
primary or active data source that receives data from different business
apps. It should act as the secondary data source or analytical database
to enhance the overall functionalities of business apps. Further, it
should be capable of integrating with different types of data like
structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. Additionally, it can
execute complex queries too.

#### Big Data Capability

NoSQL databases are good with Big data, and they can be scaled quickly
to manage voluminous data from terabytes to petabytes. Additionally, it
delivers high performance for data velocity, data complexity, and the
data variety.

#### Continuous Availability

NoSQL database is always available without any single point of failure.
All nodes in the cluster can read request even if some machine is down.
It can replicate data among different physical machines within a data
center. It avoids hardware outages too.

#### Multi-Data Center Capability

Business enterprises need highly distributed databases that are spread
across multiple data centers or graphical locales without any
performance issues. The solution includes the ability to handle multiple
data centers without concerning the overall occurrences of read and
write operations. A good NoSQL database supports multiple data centers
and provides configuration options to maintain a proper balance between
consistency and performance.

#### Separate Cache layer is not required

A good NoSQL database uses and distributes data among different
participating nodes. It does not have a separate cache layer to store
the data. The memory cache of multiple participating nodes stores data
quickly for immediate I/O access. It eliminates the problems of
synchronizing cache data with the persistent database. In this way, it
supports higher scalability with fewer management issues.

#### Cloud-Ready

The adoption of cloud platforms is increasing daily by leading
enterprises worldwide. This is the reason why every robust platform must
be cloud-ready. NoSQL databases like MongoDB are cloud-ready able to
work in a cloud setting when necessary. It supports the hybrid solution
when one part of the database is hosted within the enterprise, and
another part is hosted in the cloud.

#### High Performance and Scalability

NoSQL databases can enhance performance by adding multiple nodes to the
cluster. Usually, the performance of a database system goes down with
additional nodes to a cluster. However, a good NoSQL database increases
performance for both read and write operations when new nodes are added,
and performance gains are linear in nature.

Here, we have listed the major benefits of the NoSQL database but there
a few more as discussed by enterprises like easy to implement, easy to
use, supports multiple languages & platforms, thriven open source
community, etc.

<div id="expander-content-1681575411" class="expand-content">

SQL Server**SELECT**statement is used to fetch the data from a database
table which returns data in the form of result table. These result
tables are called**result-sets**.Retrieves rows from the database and
enables the selection of one or many rows or columns from one or many
tables in SQL Server

## Syntax

Following is the basic syntax of SELECT statement. Where, column1,
column2...are the fields of a table whose values you want to fetch.

The MS SQL Server **WHERE** clause is used to specify a condition while
fetching the data from single table or joining with multiple tables. If
the given condition is satisfied, only then it returns a specific value
from the table. You will have to use WHERE clause to filter the records
and fetch only necessary records.

Specifies the search condition for the rows returned by the query.

GROUP BY Clause

</div>

<div id="expander-content-1352817951" class="expand-content">

The SQL Server GROUP BY clause is used in collaboration with the SELECT
statement to arrange identical data into groups. The GROUP BY clause
follows the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement and precedes the ORDER BY
clause. A SELECT statement clause that divides the query result into
groups of rows, usually for the purpose of performing one or more
aggregations on each group. The SELECT statement returns one row per
group.Following is the basic syntax of GROUP BY clause. The GROUP BY
clause must follow the conditions in the WHERE clause and must precede
the ORDER BY clause if one is used.

Table Joins

</div>

<div id="expander-content-569657870" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

By using joins, you can retrieve data from two or more tables based on
logical relationships between the tables. Joins indicate how SQL Server
should use data from one table to select the rows in another table.

A join condition defines the way two tables are related in a query by:

  - Specifying the column from each table to be used for the join. A
    typical join condition specifies a foreign key from one table and
    its associated key in the other table.
  - Specifying a logical operator (for example, = or \<\>,) to be used
    in comparing values from the columns.

## Getting Started Summary

\- Selenium - It is used for Web Browser Automation

\- Appium - Mobile testing, Selenium is prerequisite to learn Appium

\- Install JDK

\- Install Eclipse LUNA (For Java Coding)

           - File \>\> New Java project (JRE System Library)

\- Every Java file has its class file, which is platform and OS
independent

\- Group of Classes bundled is called JAR file. JAR file is a collection
of many Class Files (it is also called a Package)

\- Selenium has its own JAR files (inbuilt)

\- Need to add Selenium JAR files in the eclipse, in order to use
inbuilt classes

      --\>
<http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.53/>

      -- Download - selenium-java-2.53.0.zip

      -- Unzip

      -- Under Eclipse, Add it by right click on Project \>\> Properties
\>\> Java Build Path \>\> Libraries \>\>  Add External JARs

      -- Add Main Selenium JAR and JARs under Lib to see imported JARs,
under 'Refrenced Libraries' section

\- OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

   - Main function is including only in those classes, which we want to
execute (Public Static Void Main PSVM)

   - An object is an instance of a class and we can create as many
instances (Objects) of a class as required. Objects are created in the
memory

   - Every object needs to have an object reference. Object is a memory
and object reference is a reference or point to that memory e.g. Pen p1
= new Pen();. Here p1 is reference and Pen() is a memory.

<td>Implicit Wait</td>
<td>Selenium WebDriver has borrowed the idea of implicit waits from Watir. This means that we can tell Selenium that we would like it to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception that it cannot find the element on the page. We should note that implicit waits will be in place for the entire time the browser is open. This means that any search for elements on the page could take the time the implicit wait is set for.</td>

TestNG is similar to JUnit but it is much more powerful than JUnit but still it’s inspired by JUnit. It is designed to be better than JUnit, especially when testing integrated classes. Pay special thanks to <em>Cedric Beust who is the creator of TestNG</em>.</p>
<p>TestNG eliminates most of the limitations of the older framework and gives the developer the ability to write more flexible and powerful tests with help of easy annotations, grouping, sequencing &amp; parametrizing.</p>
