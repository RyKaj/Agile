## Do you Scare Your Employees

How your employees feel about your style impacts business performance.
According to a 2018 
[study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1548051817709007?journalCode=jlob&),
managing employees with pressure tactics resulted in more than a 90%
increase in the predicted turnover of employees, while using more
inspirational tactics was related to roughly a 68%  *decrease* in likely
turnover. And  [research
shows](https://www.mbs.ac.uk/news/toxic-bosses--how-destructive-personality-traits-can-infect-a-workforce/) that
employees of toxic bosses engage in more counterproductive work
behaviors as a form of retaliation against their colleagues and leaders.

As an executive coach, I work with clients who are dealing with
intimidating bosses as well as those who exhibit negative tendencies
themselves. Here are five ways to ensure that your employees don’t
experience any unnecessary trepidation around you.

### Assume they are afraid of you, and then reflect and observe.

Given the power differential, asking employees if you make them anxious
probably won’t yield the truth. Think about how you behave in various
situations. Do you treat your employees with the courtesy you give to
customers, or do you take them for granted? Do you go overboard with
your tone and mannerisms when expressing dissatisfaction? In addition to
looking at your behavior, observe your employees’. Do people withdraw or
fail to make eye contact when around you? Do employees  [seem reluctant
to present an opposing point of
view?](https://hbr.org/2016/01/can-your-employees-really-speak-freely)

### Ask open-ended questions about team culture

Gather broader insight about how your employees see your team and feel
about work. Ask them to describe a time in the last six to 12 months
when they felt unable to express their ideas and a time when they felt
free to do so. By asking “when” instead of “if” they felt a certain way,
you will prompt them to scan their memories for real examples instead of
simply saying no and forgoing the opportunity to share.

### Check whether you are projecting your fears onto others

Many leaders cope with their  [fear of
failure](https://hbr.org/2018/12/how-to-overcome-your-fear-of-failure) by
pushing themselves and others harder, instilling the same fear in their
teams. Consider a VP whom I coached in a global Fortune 100 company,
whose staff walked on eggshells around him. An insatiable corrector of
his employees’ work, he saw himself as a perfectionist and was proud of
it. Recently promoted, he was experiencing the classic growing pains of
becoming a more senior executive. Instead of reallocating his time to
strategic concerns and empowering his team to handle tactical needs, he
micromanaged, and readily admitted that he was projecting onto the group
his worries about being able to personally deliver.

### Shift your ratio of connection and correction

Executives who  *connect *rather than  *correct* remove fear in the
workplace, replacing it with meaningful dialogue that helps to co-create
a shared definition of success. It doesn’t take a long time to shift
away from the correction habit. Over the span of a month, a CEO whom I
coached wrote three words in a journal every time he had the urge to
correct a team member: “Connect with them.” He would then suspend his
judgment and invite them to discuss a path forward. He would say, “I
know I usually correct you before getting your perspective first, and I
want to change that because I value your contribution. Let me also share
why correcting this is important to me, so we’re on the same page and
can decide a plan together.”

### Show vulnerability

Leaders who create safe cultures welcome dissent from subordinates and
concede power every once in a while in the service of increasing the
team’s commitment. But this takes vulnerability. Consider whether you
have ever, without a hint of frustration or defensiveness, allowed your
employees to prove you wrong. If you haven’t, consider doing so, and
don’t worry too much about whether it will make you look weak.
Instead, remember the pratfall effect: Generally competent people are
deemed to be more appealing when they make a mistake. And  [research
shows](https://hbr.org/2013/05/im-the-boss-why-should-i-care) that
likability is a requisite for being seen as a successful leader.

Some bosses believe that being aggressive is the only way to get
results, and there are times when that approach works. But when they
manage with no awareness of employees’ experience, leaders stand to lose
their key talent and invite more dysfunction into the workplace, which
limits productivity. By better understanding how your people view your
leadership style, you can make sure your behavior doesn’t cross the line
between pushing them hard and pushing them away.
