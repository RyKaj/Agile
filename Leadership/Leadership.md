## Team Building Exercises

### Team members are onsite

#### On-Premise

##### Campfire Stories

###### Rules

1.  Create a set of trigger words that can kickstart a storytelling session. Think of words like "first day", "work travel", "partnership", "side project", etc. Add them to sticky notes.
2.  Divide a whiteboard into two sections. Post all sticky notes from above on one section of the whiteboard.
3.  Ask a participant to pick out one trigger word from the sticky notes and use it to share an experience (say, about his/her first day at the company). Shift the chosen sticky note to the other side of the whiteboard.
4.  As the participant is relating his/her experience, ask others to jot down words that remind them of similar work-related stories. Add these words to sticky notes and paste them on the whiteboard.
5.  Repeat this process until you have a "wall of words" with interconnected stories.

#### Off-Premise
##### Scavenger Hunt
This classic team building exercise encourages teamwork and creative thinking. Put together a list of items for your team members to find. This can be done individually or in small groups. The first to collect all of the items and bring them to you, wins\!

###### Rules
Break the group into teams of two or more. Make a list of goofy tasks for each team to do as a group. Tasks can include taking a selfie with a stranger, taking a picture of a building or object around the office, etc. Give the list to each team, along with a deadline by which they must complete all tasks. Whoever completes the most tasks the quickest, wins\! (You can even create your own point system according to  [task](https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-a-task-in-project-management/) difficulty if you want\!)  

###### Objective  
Great team bonding exercise that helps break up office cliques by encouraging people to work with colleagues from other teams, departments, or just social circles.

##### Team Lunches
It is often said that food brings the company closer and it is the best reason to bring people together. So why not start organizing a team lunch session? It is similar to meeting lunches; only thing is that you and your team have lunch with your remote employees.

The tricky bit would be the time zone\! While it may only be breakfast for you, it could be dinner for your remote team. Even though it is one of the most unusual remote team building activities, having a meal together allows your team to learn new culture and cuisines from each other and from different parts of the world.

### Challenges
Synchronous and Asynchronous Work

It’s always that  **balance between synchronous work and asynchronous  work**. When people work synchronously, they are online at the same time chatting back and forth, which is really great for being connected, bonding as a team, real-time collaboration, and being creative with ideas.

On the other side is being asynchronous, and letting people respond when it suits them, not having to be in a lot of meetings, and there’s no frantic chatting going all the time, so they can work with their heads down. It’s great for writing excellent code, productivity, having a more calm work environment, and being able to have manageable hours.

When your team is more synchronous, they’ll tend to feel like they are more energetic, more creative, and more connected to everyone else, and they’ll have more sense of what’s going on in the rest of the company.  On the downside, they might feel like things move too quickly, there are too many meetings, they get left out of decisions, and they’re finding it difficult to get keep heads down.

When we&#39;re very asynchronous, everything’s happening over words and documents. Responses are a lot slower, and they are much more thoughtful, because people respond when it suits them. I’m often told people are getting a lot of great work done, they feel very productive and very balanced. At the same time, they often feel quite lonely, disconnected, and like things move slowly. They don&#39;t really know what’s going on with others. They’re all alone in their rooms, and it can get quite depressing.

Both asynchronous and synchronous communication has its advantages and disadvantages. In the following table below, we made a high-level comparison.

![Sync Async](https://codingsans.com/uploads/images/SyncAsync.jpg)

#### Balancing Synchronous and Asynchronous Work
 Managers always swing back and forth between synchronous and asynchronous, and I think at Buffer, we&#39;re starting to find a balance where the swings are not so extreme anymore. We&#39;re constantly trying to figure out how to mix the two in a healthier way—what should be synchronous and what can be asynchronous—and that’s probably the most difficult thing.
 
#### Knowledge Silos
 A problem we&#39;re always fighting at Buffer is  **knowledge silos** when only one person knows about an area of the code base. When they get sick or leave or something happens, then it’s the whole team’s problem. So, document your pull requests, write good commit messages, and leave status on  [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) cards. These practices make it less likely to develop these knowledge silos.


### Standards
#### Set clear standards of Communication
 Depending on the type of work you do, a daily or even a couple of daily meetings might be required to ensure team cohesiveness. Mandy Brown, the CEO of Editorially, a collaborative writing platform that was bought by Vox Media last year, advocates that remote teams over communicate on purpose. “On a remote team, opportunities for misunderstanding between teammates distributed across both time and geography magnify,” she wrote. Brown says one effective way to ensure communication is to record meetings so that anyone confused about what has transpired can go back and look at the record. Communication is key to effectively leading remote and distributed teams. Setting up the standard for communication and requiring it be followed will be critical.

#### Optimize the right kinds of communication tools
Productivity pros will tell you that the best way to ensure a remote participant fully engages during a meeting is to talk to them via video conference. Otherwise, employees will merely call in and then multitask or zone out while they’re on the call.

These days, offices have a wide variety of communication tools to choose from, including internal social networks, chat rooms and digital whiteboards, among others. Email is undoubtedly the most popular but some consider the least efficient mode of communication. Train your workers to use alternatives but require they video conference when working in your distributed team.

### Offshore - Communications
#### Cultural Sensitivity in Working with Other Cultures
Cultural differences can be a challenge in an international workplace, but at the same time cultural diversity can also be fascinating, said Rachel Smets. At Positive Psychology in Practice 2019 she suggested we prepare ourselves when working with other cultures or moving abroad, and develop our cultural sensitivity by learning about new cultures as much as we can.

Smets stated that among the people she interviewed, including many digital nomads like herself, the one thing they all mentioned as a key ingredient to a successful move was "prepare well". She suggested to do research in advance:
 > Depending on your current situation, your research will be based on your goals, but let’s assume you’re a digital nomad and able to work from anywhere; you need to decide about your new destination, your house or other accommodation to rent or buy, the family that will join you or stay behind, your finances, the new language, but also, the required visa and paperwork. Adding to these basics, there are topics like pets, schools, vaccinations, insurance, health care etc...

We can learn about a new culture by doing research and reading about their habits, foods, festivals, language, history, etc. Smets mentioned that it doesn’t have to be complicated; just put in some effort to inform yourself:

As a digital worker, doing business with many different cultures and showing your knowledge about certain local culture customs will demonstrate an interest in their culture, which can be very advantageous in business.

Positive psychology can be applied to help people adjust to or deal with a culture that’s new to them; it is really the answer and solution in everything here, said Smets. The science is all about happiness, optimism, well-being, satisfaction, flow, and so on, and in the pursuit of "good feeling" this also relates to your interpersonal relations with other cultures.
 
How are you adjusting to others? How are you communicating with others? Maybe they use a different language, but there’s much more to communication than that, said Smets. In the Netherlands people are very direct, blunt and may come across as "rude" to those from another country where language is indirect, and the message must be understood through cues like body language, facial expressions, or eye contact.

Smets gave the example of how some Asian people say "yes", which can have five different meanings: "yes", "maybe," "I’ll try," "no," and "I’m not sure." She mentioned her video on [deadlines  across cultures](https://youtu.be/WXXqdDzwWrg), which  provides examples and solutions to communicating across cultures.

Positive psychology can also be related to the "Golden Rule", as Smets explained:
 > We’re used to the golden rule, as in "Treat others like you would like to be treated," however, when it comes to cultural differences, the Golden Rule that is most effective is "Treat others the way THEY want to be treated". In essence, adjust to them, and harmony will be created.

"Working abroad has been a great experience in every country I’ve lived," said Smets. She mentioned that a challenge is always paperwork, such as all the tax systems, getting the utility contract done, work contracts, a visa if needed, internet at home, registrations in the new country, and the administration part is always a challenge, in some countries it being faster than others. Patience and persistence is the key solution here, Smets said.

#### Communication Patterns
Are these models true in practice? Not always, but it’s a good place to start, highlighting how differently teams approach communication and negotiation.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/external_clips/attachments/55802/original/communication-patterns-cultures.gif?1430439073)

But each culture’s perception of time can even be more complicated and conflicting than that. Take the case of how deadlines are perceived in Germany versus how they’re perceived in Spain, again from “When Cultures Collide” by Richard Lewis:

## Timezone
### Meetings and Time Management

Communication is vital when working with an offshore team. Ideas should be conveyed properly and comprehensively to swiftly and efficiently deliver the output. However, communication seems to be a lot harder than you think when your team is countries away and a few hours ahead. Some business owners find it hard to keep up with the time difference. Some even stay late at night just to set a meeting for the offshore team. Tiresome, isn’t it?

Have regular meetings.

### Language and Cultural Barrier

Different time zones, different location, and so is the practice of [different cultures](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254458811_Time_Zones_Matter_The_Impact_of_Distance_and_Time_Zones_on_Services_Trade). Let’s say, for example, an American company hired an offshore team from Asia. American culture is quite different from Asian culture. There may be some aspect that one nationality would find the actions of the other quite offensive and vice versa. This kind of misunderstanding, cultural barrier, is one of the reasons that offshore outsourcing fails. The difference of Western culture from Eastern culture is quite far-fetched that is why some businesses are having so many second thoughts and doubts when offshoring. 

###  Calendar

Offshoring from a different country also means different calendar holidays and weekends. There are countries in which their weekends are not aligned with your country’s weekends. Holidays also differ depending on which country you are doing business with, which may cause a problem. Delays, miscommunication, and poor quality are some of the consequences of time zone difference.

### Over Communicate

Communication has been a highlight in every offshoring business so it is fair to keep this one in mind at all times. When you communicate with your offshore development team, it is not enough to just schedule a fifteen-minute meeting and tell them what to do and have them carry on whatever they are doing. We encourage our clients to constantly communicate with their offshore team. It isn’t necessary to purely talk about updates and the software. Take this time to know your offshore team and share your ideas and goals so you can convey your desired outcome of the project. This will minimize misunderstanding and delays.

### Overlap Your Schedules
One of the most effective strategies is making sure that you overlap your schedule with your offshore team. It can be a few hours in the morning or in the evening. This strategy ensures that your offshore team recognizes your presence even though you are not with them physically. This also ensures that you can ask for updates and work with them for a few hours to smoothly produce the project.

### Make Use of Video Conferencing

With the various latest technology makes communication so much easier for businesses. Distance and time zone difference is no longer seen as a terrible hindrance compared to earlier years. With the use of applications and the internet, you can simply contact your offshore team for a video conference. Make sure that you constantly ask for updates and ask your team if there are problems or difficulties to ensure that communication is open.

## Treat Them Like Your Own Team

One thing not to forget is that your offshore team is part of your team. Though they are located halfway around the world, they work on your project and are aiming the same goals. Your offshore team is not an outsider, rather they are an extension of your team.  

Working across multiple time zone can be very tricky but very beneficial once you [properly execute this strategy](https://fullscale.io/tips-for-managing-an-offshore-development-team/). Matt DeCoursey and Matt Watson, founders of Full Scale, have encountered the challenges in working across time zones. Since 2009, they have recruited developers from the Philippines to work on projects of their respective companies and they successfully overcame that challenge. Now, they are sharing this strategy to other startups who wish to scale up their businesses. Full Scale makes sure that the time zone difference does not create chaos while working on a project thus the creation of our development process, [Guided Development](https://fullscale.io/our-services/).

At Full Scale, your ideas are valued more than anything else. You are in control of your project, on how it should be produced. We take the burden of finding suitable developers off your plate. We do recruitment, assessment, and hiring. During the production, we also have project managers that can help manage your offshore team. Pair our development process with the tips and guides above, your business will scale up the just like how you want it.

Don’t let the time zones stop you from achieving your business goals. Be wise in handling your time and your team. Choose the right offshore development center.

### Keep Their Work Queue Full, Including "B" Tasks

There will be many times when your offshore team may get stuck and need help from someone else. The last thing you want to do is have them get stuck and get nothing accomplished.

There are countless reasons that developers get stuck in middle of their work. From weird compilation issues check in by someone else, business logic questions, lack of clear requirements, etc.

I suggest always having multiple work items in their queue so if they get stuck, they have someone else they can work on. If they get stuck on their “A” task, make sure they have a “B” or “C” priority item they can work on in the meantime.


### Give them Real Work To Do

Just because you can find offshore developers for $25 an hour, that doesn’t mean you need to only give them shit work to do. They make $25 an hour because the cost of living where they live is a fraction of Silicon Valley, not because they are junior developers.

Just as your developers hate doing shitty projects, so do they. If you want to recruit and retain top talent on your offshore team, do not make them do shit work.

I recently hired a developer in our Cebu City, Philippines office that worked at IBM for the last 6 years in Cebu. He might be the smartest developer I have ever hired. He is also the best value I have ever gotten for my money.

Set your expectations high. There are highly skilled developers all over the world. Treat them like it\!

### Don&#39;t Micromanage

Nobody likes to be micromanaged. It is also hard to scale your development team if you can’t empower them and trust them to do the work that needs to be done. It is important that your offshore team has a strong senior developer that can act as a team lead.

If you are having problems getting things done properly, consider if your offshore team lacks senior level leadership. Many companies make the mistake of just trying to hire a bunch of cheap developers.

It is in the best interest of you and your offshore partner both to ensure that your offshore team can be self managing and successful. Make sure you have the right mix of senior developers and potentially a project manager.

### Standardize Communication Tools

This one seems obvious of course.  When you&#39;re working with someone at least a continent away, you better know how to get a hold of them, or what do you have really?  Someone you are paying for work you may not actually be getting.

This is a huge issue in the outsourcing industry, and can be a huge cause of concern for those people who have never worked with an offshore team - many managers who have onshore/offshore couplings report that prior to implementing this structure, this is the \#1 fear about offshoring their onshore folks report.

(**Disclosure**: at [ModPH](http://modph.com/) - which I founded and run - we use implementation coordinators and a standard set of tools to prevent this feeling from turning into an accepted fact from day 1 - [contact us](http://modph.com/contact-us/) to find out how.)

Email, while necessary for some things, should be limited in its use.  Email is an asynchronous communication method - asynchronous meaning *not at the same time*.  If you work in the same physical  office with someone and want to talk to them, just them, would you send them an email or would you turn around and just *talk to them*.  Of course you would do the latter.  If you use email (with or without a time difference) you automatically cause a delay in communication. That may be ok for some things, but generally is not in today&#39;s working world.

Your offshore team mate should be no different.  I recommend a group skype chat between you and your offshore team mate that others can join if necessary.  If you’re using slack or another messaging app internally, make sure they&#39;re on it.  Talk via voice frequently, or use video when you can (it&#39;s been reported that 90% of all communication is non-verbal - the most common cause of things “getting lost in translation”).

### Manage the Workflow

No matter where work is done, in our modern working environment, you have absolutely no excuse not to have some type of workflow management solution in place. It doesn&#39;t have to be complex, or full-featured, or anything more than a shared to-do list.  But it must be visible to all, must have a way to communicate priority, and it must record who is changing what.

There are a number of different tools with these essential qualities.  If you need something with time tracking that&#39;s full-featured - I&#39;m partial to Jetbrain&#39;s [Youtrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/) (it&#39;s also very good at managing per-piece work); It can do time time tracking, priorities, and gives you a visual view of what&#39;s work is in what status (via a [kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)).

For the most simplistic view, a shared google sheet is sufficient.  Just have columns for work description, work type (helpful for grouping things and seeing patterns among tasks, essential for growth), submit date, due date, notes and of course status.  You may add columns as your specific style of work requires. I used to use a tool called [workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) which was great for me individually, but one team member used to have trouble working with it in shared lists, even though we worked closely together; but it&#39;s a dead-simple solution.

[Asana](https://asana.com/) is probably the best solution in between the two (though I&#39;m sure there are others).  It&#39;s much more team focused, and the ability to put things into projects, or share projects among a bunch of different people is great, especially when you need your offshore person to interact with more than just their buddy on projects.

### Patience
As I&#39;ve said before in this post, 90% of all communication is non-verbal.  I&#39;m not sure I believe it&#39;s that high, but ultimately when working with offshore what this translates into is simply less efficient communication.  SO, if in our modern workplace we rely on communication to get someone up to speed, then inherently that communication is going to be slower, and thus progress of training will be slower, because the person we&#39;re trying to train isn&#39;t right in front of us.  Logical.

But all is not lost.  A LOT can be done through video/voice, and even text chat. There&#39;s a lot that CAN&#39;T be done through email. It&#39;s best to accept the fact that our workplace today is increasingly distributed, and will continue to be so.  The salient fact is that your communications with your offshore buddy won&#39;t be as speedy as with someone face to face.  So having a little patience with this understanding will go along way toward making you successful in working with your offshore folks.

If you&#39;re currently working with offshore staff or thinking about it, take these 5 things to make your daily work with them faster, better, and smoother, I know you&#39;ll be happy with the results\!


## Onboarding
### New Team Members
#### Selecting New Team Members

Your initial team is set up and you&#39;ve met with at least the top members of the distributed team you’ve decided to work with and the rest via online conferencing (with video\!). Your software product/platform is going great, it attracts more and more users and you need to fuel the growth by adding more people to the team. Now here is the tricky part – you need to make sure you attract the right people;  not only in terms of expertise, but also in terms of fitting in with the existing team and sticking to the same practices and standards.

There is an interesting experiment where one person pretends to be a slacker and demoralizes the experiment team. It turns out that if there is a strong formal or informal team leader, he or she can negate the bad influence of this person. But what if you get more of these people?

One of my main jobs as CEO of a custom software development company is to make sure we don&#39;t have any misfits within the team. That&#39;s why we have a 2 step (for seniors even a 3 step) interview process that is testing both soft and hard skills. We&#39;re very careful in our selection and we&#39; re very quick to fire during the trial period . But if you are working with remote freelancers, make sure you do a thorough interview before bringing someone in\!

Additionally, conduct a 2<sup>nd</sup> interview which tests their team work, interpersonal skills, as well as their fit for the culture you want to establish in your product team\!

#### How You Onboard Might Be Even More Important

An experiment run by one of the biggest IT companies worldwide showed that with good on boarding, you can get double the employee engagement in just one hour\! This sounds like one of the best 1-hour investments you can ever do for your project\!

I have made the mistake of on boarding people by telling them how great the company is and how interesting the project/team he is joining is.  It turns out it is far better to ask the newcomer about them and let them talk. You can ask questions about:

  - their past experience and how it fits in the project
  - what motivates them and what unique skills they have
  - what are their personal aims/hobbies/challenges outside of work

And to increase engagement – if the person is at another location (e.g. a software partner like us), send something small, like a branded T-shirt, a key holder or anything that the person can receive as a token for being part of the team.

#### Team Member with No Previous Experience with Remote Teams

We put a lot of effort into on boarding for anybody, even if they have worked remotely before, and if they haven’t, we note that in the on boarding document to give extra support. Previous remote experience is not a requirement for people joining Buffer.

##### Discuss Everything Up-Front

We&#39;ll talk to them about where they are going to work from, how they will set up their workspace, how they are going to set up their schedule, how they are going to stay healthy and productive at the same time, and how they will have enough work time and also not too much work time. We believe it’s key to talk to them very openly and very honestly about the lovely advantages of a remote team, and the hard part of it as well, to make sure they consider every aspect.

##### Create Clear Goals

Every developer gets a 30-, 60-, and 90-day on boarding plan, which has really clear goals.

#### Assign a Culture Buddy

They’ll also get a culture buddy, whose job is to talk to this person once a week, advise on their challenges, and how to work better remotely, how to communicate with their team, how to stay healthy and how to stay productive.

## Warning Signs
### Things that should never surprise a boss
### When an Employee Quits

If you&#39;re blindsided by an employee&#39;s departure, you&#39;re doing something wrong. 

Employees ideally should feel comfortable telling their managers if they feel unhappy or unsatisfied, says Julie Zhuo, author and vice president of product design at Facebook. Unexpected departures can also cause [serious disruption to business operations and profits](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-your-best-employees-are-going-to-quit-2016-10). 

Zhuo recommends checking in with employees regularly so you can have a better sense when employees feel dissatisfied: "I wouldn&#39;t want to be surprised and think that somehow they were perfectly happy and that everything was roses when they announced that they&#39;re going to do something else," Zhou [told Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-vp-julie-zhuo-boss-employee-relationship-2019-4).

### When an employee hates you
If you can&#39;t detect when employees hate them or feel unhappy with your management, there&#39;s a problem.

Although employees work hard to keep their true feelings about a boss secret, managers should be on the radar for subtle signs there&#39;s dissatisfaction among their ranks (signs range from a lack of eye contact to refusing to smile at you).

Learning when your employees don&#39;t like you can prevent them from quitting and boost productivity, international business speaker and author Michael Kerr told [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-your-employees-secretly-hate-you-2015-9#theyre-short-with-you-10). "If your employees are beginning to sound like your moody teenager, then that&#39;s a pretty big red flag," he said.

###  When an employee is bored
Good managers always know when employees are spending more time scrolling social media or internet shopping than working.

Employees that are constantly bored will have more of an incentive to quit, Lynn Taylor, workplace expert and author of "[Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant](https://www.amazon.com/Tame-Your-Terrible-Office-Tyrant/dp/0470457643/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1248579303&sr=8-1&tag=bisafetynet-20safetynet-20)," told [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-you-should-quit-your-job-2017-7#youre-bored-all-the-time-1). If an employee tries telling you they no longer feel challenged, you&#39;d be better off taking them seriously.

### When your employee fails

Employees want to be challenged, so setting them up for failure may help them in the long run.

Jake Poses, CEO of teaching startup JumpRope, [purposely gives his younger employees a task that&#39;s too big](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-manage-millennials-2017-11). The practice of "goal-setting" also occurs at Google, where managers [expect employees to fall short](https://www.businessinsider.com/laszlo-bock-googlers-arent-expected-to-hit-all-their-goals-2016-3) of their given tasks.

Expecting failure from employees not only helps challenge them, but also lets you know the true all-stars who can somehow master the assignment.

### When an employee comes to you with suggestions on how to improve

Good managers will expect employees to come to them with suggestions on things they can do better.

Creating a culture where employees feel comfortable coming to you with "[feedforward](https://www.businessinsider.com/marshall-goldsmith-feedforward-2016-8)" — or suggestions on how to improve in the future — can improve workplace morale without having awkward conversations about a manager&#39;s shortcomings. In fact, refusing to seek feedback is the biggest mistake leaders can make, a former Google executive Meg Crosby [told Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/former-google-exec-meg-crosby-top-mistake-leaders-make-2016-4).

"The more CEOs \[and leaders\] can get that very candid feedback and value that and understand it and think about it as they&#39;re making decisions, the better the decisions they will make," Crosby said.


### What your employee&#39;s weakness is

Employers rarely inquire about their workers&#39; shortcomings — but they should, says Sarah Wagener, chief people officer at DoorDash.

Wagener encourages managers to [create a space where employees feel comfortable talking about their weaknesses](https://www.businessinsider.com/boss-employees-areas-for-improvement-2018-12). Creating a culture where employees can openly state their weaknesses will allow good managers to help them improve, while helping workers find more avenues for career growth.

### Whether you need to fire an employee

No one likes handing out pink slips, but good managers [need to know when to fire an employee](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-you-should-fire-someone-2016-11): "It&#39;s a necessity if you want to have a thriving business," says John Rampton, entrepreneur and founder of productivity service [Calendar](https://www.calendar.com/).

When employees are gone more often than not, are argumentative, or customers despise them, these are signs [your workers have overstayed their welcome](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-you-should-fire-someone-2016-11).

###  Your employee’s ideas for the company

An effective leader actively [seeks out employee input](https://www.businessinsider.com/ultimate-guide-how-to-become-better-boss-30-days-2019-4#day-21-show-humility-by-listening-to-other-peoples-ideas-22) when making big decisions — and good managers should expect employees to feel comfortable expressing their vision for the company.

Humble leaders, including those open to their employees&#39; ideas and perspectives, [facilitate better team performance](https://www.businessinsider.com/humble-leaders-are-good-for-teams-2016-12) and inspires team members to work harder.

### When a new hire won’t last very long
Hiring can be a gamble; you never truly know how good an employee is before you hire them.

Good managers, however, [stay aware of signs that a new hire won&#39;t make it out of the probation period](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-new-employee-wont-last-long-2017-5).

If your new hire won&#39;t talk to team members, strays from company policies, and poaches responsibilities from others, a good manager might have to ask them to leave.

### What an employee’s ultimate career goals are

If you don&#39;t know what your employee&#39;s ultimate career goals are, you are practically handing them a reason to leave.

In fact, talking about career-development is crucial to retaining talent, [Harvard Business Review reports](https://hbr.org/2008/02/are-you-giving-your-top-perfor). HBR found better career development opportunities was the primary reason most employees left for different companies — even above higher pay.

Yet many managers find talking to employees about career development can be time consuming or awkward. To get to know what your employee&#39;s ultimate career objectives are, HBR recommends managers simply bite the bullet and [ask](https://hbr.org/2008/02/are-you-giving-your-top-perfor).

### When you shouldn’t hire someone

Managers may be torn over [whether a forgotten thank-you note calls for disqualification](https://www.businessinsider.com/thank-you-notes-interview-job-2019-4) from a job, but there are some clear-cut reasons not to hire a candidate.

If a candidate has poor references, comes unprepared to interviews, and cannot follow job-application directions, [JobMonkey](https://www.jobmonkey.com/employer-insights/reasons-not-hire-someone/) argues there should be little to no surprise that the candidate does not take the role seriously enough to be considered.

### When an employee asks for a raise

Getting blindsided by an employee asking for more money can lead to awkward, tricky conversations for managers.

No manager should go into any review winging it, not just for raise purposes,”Karan Dillon, former editor of the Harvard Business Review, told [The Muse](https://www.themuse.com/advice/ultimate-guide-managers-responding-raise-promotion-requests-review-season).

To better prepare for getting asked about a raise, managers should tell employees before performance reviews whether or not the budget allows for a raise, and put the work in to evaluate whether employee performance exceeds expectations.

### When an employee gives you criticism

Receiving negative feedback from your employees can be a tough pill to swallow. If you&#39;re not expecting the feedback, you run the risk of getting defensive, over-apologizing, and acting on emotion — all ways to ruin your professional reputation, says [The Muse](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-ways-not-to-handle-negative-feedback).

Instead, good managers should prepare themselves to receive criticism from direct reports. [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-right-way-to-respond-to-negative-feedback) suggests forming a group of "loving critics," or trustworthy sources that will be brutally honest about your performance when asked.
