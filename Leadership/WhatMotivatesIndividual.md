# Leadership : What Motivates Individual

Everyone has different priority that motivates them at work. 
Motivational psychologists and researchers have, in recent years, discovered more about what motivates us than what we know from decades of past research. In particular, they have discovered that we are all born possessing three innate, universal needs (Deci and Ryan):

The need for Competency…being masterful
The need for Autonomy..being free to make our own choices
The need for Relatedness…being accepted and cherished by others

Then, as we mature, we add additional needs, such as Purpose, Meaning and yes, even Money/Possessions and Power.  We sometimes even internalize these additional needs to such an extent that they transform from being extrinsic to intrinsic.

I usually ask the team individually to rank the list below to provide insight on their motivation.

Based off the results, custom my 1:1 to help that individual.
