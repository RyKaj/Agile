# Leadership : Exit Interview


An  **exit interview** is a survey conducted with an individual who is
separating from an 
[organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization "Organization") or
relationship. Most commonly, this occurs between an 
[employee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee "Employee") and an
organization, a student and an educational institution, or a member and
an association. An organization can use the information gained from an
exit 
[interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview "Interview") to
assess what should be improved, changed, or remain intact. More so, an
organization can use the results from exit interviews to reduce
employee, student, or member 
[turnover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_\(employment\) "Turnover (employment)") and
increase 
[productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity "Productivity") and
engagement, thus reducing the high costs associated with turnover.

The real reason businesses conduct exit interviews is to get information
about an employee’s work experience with the company.  This information
could be valuable all on its own or used with other exit interview
data.  To gather relevant information, there are a few things to keep
in mind when structuring the exit interview process.

This may be your employer’s last chance to ask for formal feedback from
you. They’d love to know why you’ve opted to leave, and what you really
think about them. That way they can strive to reduce future turnover and
fix internal problems.  
  
So they set up a meeting to ask for your opinions. At larger employers
the session could be with Human Resources, or even with an external
supplier who specializes in such consultations. In smaller
establishments you might meet with a manager from another division.

## Prepare

Managers or Team Leads

  - Set up a 30 mins to 1 hour 1 on 1 meeting with the employee that is
    leaving. It would be good to send an Outlook meeting to block out
    time in both calendar.
  - Do not use the word exit, leave, leaving in the meeting subject. Do
    not provide any indication that it is an exit interview
  - Ensure the meeting is an open two way communication

## Questions to Ask

  - Why are you leaving your current position?
  - How would you describe the culture of our company?
  - How do you feel things went here?
  - Do you have suggestions for improvements?
  - Where are we coming up short?
  - Was there a particular reason you’ve decided to move on?
  - What could we have done that would have persuaded you to stay?
  - What is your new employer giving you that you did not get from us?
  - How does your new job fulfill your career goals?
  - Would you like us to stay in touch to let you know about future
    opportunities?
