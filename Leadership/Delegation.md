# Leadership : Delegation


Once a leader has begun to shift his or her mindset, it’s time to start
shifting behaviors. In my own work as a leadership coach, I have
identified eight practices of leaders who delegate successfully:

1.  They pick the right person — and it isn’t always about who  *can* do
    it. Who needs to develop these skills? Who has capacity? Who has
    shown interest? Who is ready for a challenge? Who would see this as
    a reward? Successful delegators also explain why they chose the
    person to take on the task.
2.  They’re clear about what the person is responsible for and how much
    autonomy they have. In  *[Drive: The Surprising Science About What
    Motivates
    Us,](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates-ebook/dp/B004P1JDJO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1466286252&sr=1-1&keywords=driven+daniel+pink)*
     Daniel Pink writes that people often want autonomy over task, team,
    technique, and time. Successful delegators let their team members
    know exactly where they have autonomy and where they don’t (yet).
3.  They describe the desired results in detail. This includes setting
    clear expectations about the outcome (“what it is”), how the task
    fits into the bigger picture (“why we’re doing it”), and criteria
    for measuring success (“what it should look like when done well”).
4.  They make sure that team members have the resources they need to do
    the job, whether it’s training, money, supplies, time, a private
    space, adjusted priorities, or help from others.
5.  They establish checkpoints, milestones, and junctures for feedback
    so that they neither micromanage nor under-lead.
6.  They encourage new, creative ways for team members to accomplish
    goals. It’s important for delegators to set aside their attachment
    to how things have been done in the past, so that they can invite,
    recognize, and reward novel approaches that work.
7.  They create a motivating environment. Successful delegators know
    when to cheerlead, coach, step in, step back, adjust expectations,
    make themselves available, and celebrate successes.
8.  They tolerate risks and mistakes, and use them as learning
    opportunities, rather than as proof that they shouldn’t have
    delegated in the first place.

Delegating well helps leaders maximize their resources, ensuring that
they’re focusing on their highest priorities, developing their team
members, and creating a culture where delegation isn’t just expected —
it’s embedded in the culture.

Successful business leaders and managers don't take on more work than
everyone else; instead, they build teams that they are comfortable
delegating work to and entrusting it will get done, according to a
recent 
[infographic](https://www.headwaycapital.com/blog/get-better-delegating/) from
Headway Capital.

The research backs up this claim: CEOs skilled in delegating generate
33% greater revenue than those with low or limited delegating skills,
and also created more jobs, a  [Gallup
poll](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/182414/delegating-huge-management-challenge-entrepreneurs.aspx) found.
However, more than 85% of managers said they should delegate more, but
are held back by feelings of guilt, habits, or a lack of trust,  [other
research](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Gift_of_Time.md?id=JLnlBQAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description) said.
