# Information Technology : Manager handoffs


There are so many potential pitfalls when getting a new manager. Your
new manager might not be familiar with all that you’ve done already,
which could slow your career momentum. You can hope that your former
manager and new manager did a handoff in which they shared lots of
information like your goals, previous achievements, feedback you’ve
received, and anything else that it’s helpful for a manager to know. But
if they  *did* have this handoff, it probably happened behind closed
doors - you likely have no idea what was discussed, if everything was
captured, and (the scariest bit) - whether or not the way your former
manager represented things matches how  *you* perceive the same things.

An Engineering Director at Etsy showed me a new way to do manager
handoffs that combats these pitfalls: a 1:1:1 (“one to one to one”). A
1:1 is between you and your manager; a 1:1:1 includes both your former
manager, AND your new manager, and is an opportunity to ensure your
career momentum doesn’t experience that hiccup.

## What's the goal of 1:1:1 manager handoff

You, your previous manager, and your new manager meet in the same room
or video call. Most of the talking happens between the managers, but
there should be clear opportunities for you (the direct report) to jump
in as you feel like it.

The goals are:

  - share relevant information from the previous manager to the new
    manager about the direct report,
  - do this transparently such that the direct report can get a good
    sense of whether there’s things unsaid or things that differ from
    their own perception, with an opportunity to disagree or clarify,
    and
  - reduce the natural career friction, pausing, or hiccups that happen
    when a person gets a new manager.

This is an opportunity to turn an otherwise lossy process into a much
more thorough, supportive process for a direct report.

### Agenda

Before this meeting happens, either manager should send out an invite
stating expectations for the meeting, what each person should prepare
for it, and what the goal is. Here’s an example:

> Hey  *Other Manager* and  *Direct Report*\! I’m booking an hour for us
> to do a ‘manager handoff’, with  *Direct Report* sitting at the table,
> too\!
> 
> *Former Manager* will cover:
> 
>   - Most recent review cycle feedback
>   - More recent feedback, projects, and other info since the last
>     review cycle
>   - *Direct Report*’s goals, growth areas, things for  *New
>     Manager* to know
> 
> *Direct Report*, this will also be an opportunity for you to
> agree/disagree with how these things are described/characterized, and
> also an opportunity for you to have a complete picture of the info
> shared between  *Former Manager* and  *New Manager*. The goal is to
> make sure we’re transparent in the handoff of your career, how you
> want to grow, and the best ways  *New Manager* can support you.
> 
> This stuff can naturally be very awkward for all involved :) This is
> okay (and normal\!) - it’s awkwardness in service of clarity and fully
> supporting  *Direct Report*’s career path, which can otherwise be
> muddled in manager changes.

I brought Etsy’s internal Charter of Mindful Communication over to
Kickstarter Engineering when I joined. I usually reference that in the
agenda, too, including reminders that each person in the meeting is
responsible to do the following:

  - Consider power dynamics. They are pervasive and exist even if – and
    where – we wish they didn’t.
  - Meet transparency with responsibility.
  - Prepare to be surprised.

### The 1:1:1

One of the managers should start by  **restating the
goals** (transparent handoff of career and manager info, an opportunity
for the direct report to clarify and even disagree with what’s said, and
reduced changes to the direct report’s career momentum).

After the restating of goals, the former manager should  **share their
context** directly to the new manager. Again, this is awkward, as the
direct report is sitting right there, listening\! But as much as
possible, be transparent and honest (while mindful) as you share your
context, history, feedback, goals, etc.

The new manager should feel free to  **ask questions** as it happens
naturally. Get clarification, aim for that shared understanding of
history, goals, etc.

If the direct report is quiet, the new manager should be routinely
asking them - how do you feel so far about what’s been said?  **Does
this description match your experience?** Are we missing something on
that topic? Anything we should clarify? Anything you disagree with?

I’ve seen this be a super boring meeting where everything is clear and
agreed with. I’ve seen this get sticky and uncomfortable when a direct
report has an opposing viewpoint or different recollection. As
necessary, acknowledge out loud that it’s okay if this is awkward. If it
gets to a point where the dialog isn’t productive anymore, the new
manager should talk with the direct report separately and privately
about their experience. It’s totally natural that the former manager and
direct report have different perceptions of the same events or feedback
- we’re humans, which means this stuff is messy. Where it helps, restate
those original meeting goals.

More often than not, even when things get uncomfortable, it’s still a
really productive use of everyone’s time, and starts the new reporting
relationship off on a much healthier foot. It’ll be quicker for the new
manager and direct report to form a trusting relationship. And thanks to
the shared understanding of events that the new manager had no prior
firsthand experience with,  *hopefully* nothing is changed about the
timeline for the direct report’s future promotion process, trajectory
towards goals, etc.

### The follow-up

If the former manager was surprised that at the direct report’s
perception of the same events, this is a great reminder to be
continually checking in with one’s reports, gathering  *their* feedback,
and reducing surprise wherever possible.

If the direct report was surprised at how things were described by their
former manager, this is  *also* a nice reminder to routinely check in on
how your manager is thinking and feeling about things, especially
feedback they have for you. While ideally managers are giving routine
feedback, your career path is truly your own responsibility; do the work
to make sure you have a shared understanding with your manager about
your path forward.

And lastly, where possible, make sure documentation of all this context
(like previous reviews, lists of goals, etc.) are shared between folks
and easily surfaced. I have an Evernote file with each person’s answers
to those first 1:1 questions, which makes it super easy to share in the
future with a new manager.
