# Leadership : GROW Model

The GROW model is an action-oriented framework fro structuring coaching and mentoring sessions. It is a simple method for goal setting and problem sovling.

         <td style="text-align:center"><strong>G</strong>row</td>
         <td>
            The Goal is the end point, where the client wants to be. The goal has to be defined in such a way that it is very clear to the client when they have achieved it.
            The Goal section of GROW is addressed at the beginning of each session and referred to again from time to time to keep the focus moving forward, especially if the coachee becomes stuck. It raises energy and clarifies thinking. Identifying what we want to achieve puts us on the path to accomplishing it by focusing on the solution rather than the problem.

         <td>
            The current Reality is where the client is now. What are the issues, the challenges, how far are they away from their goal?
            This is an exploration of the coachee’s world at the moment. Time spent here helps people get clear about what is happening and how it affects themselves and others. It provides an opportunity for viewing issues from different perspectives.         
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td style="text-align:center"><strong>O</strong>ptions</td>
         <td>
            Once Obstacles have been identified, the client needs to find ways of dealing with them if they are to make progress. These are the Options.
            Coachees will move naturally towards the Options stage as their Reality becomes clearer. Often they show a new energy by sitting up and smiling, or a lighter tone of voice.         
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td style="text-align:center"><strong>W</strong>ill</td>
         <td>
            The Options then need to be converted into action steps which will take the client to their goal. These are the Way Forward. The "W" of GROW can also include When and by Whom and the Will (or intention or commitment) to do it.
            As opposed to ‘Options’, which brings to light all possibilities, ‘Will’ is about discovering which actions the coachee can commit to undertaking. When asked, ‘What will you do about this?’ there is a danger that the coachee will make a list of what they think they should do, rather than choosing a pathway which suits their talents and ways of behaviour. The classic example is where a man commits to joining a gym because he wants to lose weight. However, if he is never going to attend because he hates going to the gym, he would get more benefit from committing to walk his dog every morning, if that is something he would enjoy.
