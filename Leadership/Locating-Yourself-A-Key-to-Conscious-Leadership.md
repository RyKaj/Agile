# Leadership : Locating Yourself - A Key to Conscious Leadership

Where are you? Are you above the line or below the line? How would you
know? What can you do to move yourself and your team to spend more time
above the line, knowing we are designed as humans to spend more time
below the line? Fantastic quick 3 minute video I recommend you all watch
to start a conversation with yourself, and your team.

Real eye opener. Thanks to Conscious Leadership Group for the great work
you do. DX is on a mission to create a more self-aware and human world
by creating experiences to motivate leaders and teams to spend more time
above the line, with the empathy our brain is telling us not to.
