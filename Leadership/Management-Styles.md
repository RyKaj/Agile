# Leadership : Management Styles

## Douglas McGregor - XY theory of Manangement

### XY theory of Manangement


A **Theory X** management style may be well-suited for this type of
structured, process-driven workplace. Studies have shown that the Theory
X style of management results in tight control, strict policies, and a
punishment and rewards system that reinforces beliefs. Employees are
initially obedient, but eventually dissatisfied and even rebellious,
driving down productivity and achieving contradictory outcomes, further
reinforcing the belief that workers are lazy and have to be externally
motivated.

**Theory Y** results in an arrangement whereby individuals can achieve
their own goals and happily accomplish the organization’s goals at the
same time. **Theory Y** managers will make different choices about how
to arrange team members and workflows, how to talk to people, how to
reward and incentivize, etc. **Theory Y** managers appeal to a higher
level of motivation on Maslow’s famous **Hierarchy of Needs**,
capitalizing on the human need for esteem and self-actualization.

### Theory X - 'Authoritarian Management' Style

  - The average person dislikes work and will avoid it if he/she can.
  - Therefore most people must be forced with the threat of punishment
    to work towards organisational objectives.
  - The average person prefers to be directed; to avoid responsibility;
    is relatively unambitious, and wants security above all else.

#### Characteristics of an X-Theory Manager

Perhaps the most noticeable aspects of McGregor's **Theory X** - and the
easiest to illustrate - are found in the behaviour of autocratic
managers and organizations which use autocratic management styles.

#### What are the characteristics of a Theory X manager? Typically some, most or all of these:

  - Results-driven and deadline-driven, to the exclusion of everything else
  - Intolerant
  - Issues deadlines and ultimatums
  - Distant and detached
  - Aloof and arrogant
  - Elitist
  - Short temper
  - Shouts
  - Issues instructions, directions, edicts
  - Issues threats to make people follow instructions
  - Demands, never asks
  - Does not participate
  - Does not team-build
  - Unconcerned about staff welfare, or morale
  - Proud, sometimes to the point of self-destruction
  - One-way communicator
  - Poor listener
  - Fundamentally insecure and possibly neurotic
  - Anti-social
  - Vengeful and recriminatory
  - Does not thank or praise
  - Withholds rewards, and suppresses pay and remunerations levels
  - Scrutinises expenditure to the point of false economy
  - Seeks culprits for failures or shortfalls
  - Seeks to apportion blame instead of focusing on learning from the experience and preventing recurrence
  - Does not invite or welcome suggestions
  - Takes criticism badly and likely to retaliate if from below or peer group
  - Poor at proper delegating - but believes they delegate well
  - Thinks giving orders is delegating
  - Holds on to responsibility but shifts accountability to subordinates
  - Relatively unconcerned with investing in anything to gain future improvements
  - Unhappy

#### Characteristics of a Theory Y Manager

  - Effort in work is as natural as work and play.
  - People will apply self-control and self-direction in the pursuit of
    organisational objectives, without external control or the threat of
    punishment.
  - Commitment to objectives is a function of rewards associated with
    their achievement.
  - People usually accept and often seek responsibility.
  - The capacity to use a high degree of imagination, ingenuity and
    creativity in solving organisational problems is widely, not
    narrowly, distributed in the population.
  - In industry, the intellectual potential of the average person is
    only partly utilized.

### Implications of Theory X and Theory Y

Quite a few organizations use **Theory X** today. **Theory X**
encourages use of tight control and supervision. It implies that
employees are reluctant to organizational changes. Thus, it does not
encourage innovation.

Many organizations are using **Theory Y** techniques. **Theory Y**
implies that the managers should create and encourage a work environment
which provides opportunities to employees to take initiative and
self-direction. Employees should be given opportunities to contribute to
organizational well-being. **Theory Y** encourages decentralization of
authority, teamwork and participative decision-making in an
organization. **Theory Y** searches and discovers the ways in which an
employee can make significant contributions in an organization. It
harmonizes and matches employees’ needs and aspirations with
organizational needs and aspirations.

### Behaviour Theory X vs Y

Theory X and Theory Y was an idea devised by Douglas McGregor (see 
[article](https://www.economist.com/news/2008/10/03/douglas-mcgregor))
in his 1960 book “The Human Side of Enterprise”. It encapsulated a
fundamental distinction between management styles and has formed the
basis for much subsequent writing on the subject.

Theory X is an authoritarian style where the emphasis is on
“productivity, on the concept of a fair day's work, on the evils of
feather-bedding and restriction of output, on rewards for performance …
\[it\] reflects an underlying belief that management must counteract an
inherent human tendency to avoid work”. Theory X is the style that
predominated in business after the mechanistic system of scientific
management had swept everything before it in the first few decades of
the 20th century.

### Differences Between Theory X and Theory Y

Motivation implies the act of stimulating or inspiring subordinates to
pursue the desired course of action. It is something that makes people
act or behave in a particular manner. Based on the premises concerning
human behaviour,  **Prof. Douglas McGregor** put forward a theory of
motivation, called as theory X and theory Y.  **Theory X** is a
conventional approach to motivation, based on negative assumptions.

On the other extreme,  **Theory Y** is diametrically opposite to theory
X which shows the modern and dynamic approach to individuals and relies
on the assumptions that are practical in nature. In this article, we are
going to talk about the major differences between Theory X and Theory Y.

### Definition of Theory X

Theory X is a traditional model of motivation and management. It takes
into consideration, the pessimistic behaviour of an average human being,
who is less ambitious and inherently lazy. Authoritarian management
style is applied by the management, where the managers closely monitor
and supervise each employee.

The premises on which theory X relies are listed below:

  - By nature, an individual is indolent and will avoid work, to the
    extent possible.
  - The average individual is unambitious, doesn’t like responsibilities
    and prefers supervision.
  - He/She is self-oriented and unconcerned about organisational
    objectives.
  - The employee resists change and gives the highest priority to job
    security.
  - He/She is not very clever and can easily be deceived.

On the basis of above assumptions, it is concluded that the management
is held responsible for organising resources, for the firm, with the aim
of economic gain. Next, the management directs the efforts of the
employees and motivate and control their actions, to make them work as
per the needs of the organisation. Further, they must be monitored,
persuaded, rewarded and punished, or else they will remain idle.

### Definition of Theory Y

Theory Y is a modern approach on motivation, put forward by McGregor. It
uses the participative style of management and assumes that workforce is
self-directed and enjoy the work assigned to them, in the accomplishment
of organisational objectives. According to the theory, employees are the
most precious asset to the company. Given below are the major
assumptions of this model:

  - The employees usually like work and are natural like play and rest.
    The performance of work is discretionary and provides a sense of
    fulfilment, if meaningful.
  - He/She can deploy self-control and self-motivation, in the pursuance
    of organisational objectives.
  - The rewards in relation to the achievement lead to commitment
    towards objectives.
  - An average worker, do not escape responsibility, rather he/she seeks
    it.
  - The capabilities and calibre of the employees are underutilised, who
    possess unlimited potential.

Based on these assumptions, it can be deduced that management is held
responsible for arranging the resources with the aim of achieving
economic and social ends. Further, the employees are not indolent by
nature, but they behave so, because of experience. Moreover, it is the
management’s duty to create such an environment for the employees to
help them achieve their goals.

### Managing an X-theory Boss

Working for an X theory boss isn't easy - some extreme X theory managers
make extremely unpleasant managers, but there are ways of managing these
people upwards. Avoiding confrontation (unless you are genuinely being
bullied, which is a different matter) and delivering results are the key
tactics.

  - Theory X managers (or indeed Theory Y managers displaying Theory X
    behaviour) are primarily results-oriented, so orientate your own
    discussions and dealings with them around results - ie what you can
    deliver and when.
  - Theory X managers are facts and figures oriented - so cut out the
    incidentals, be able to measure and substantiate anything you say
    and do for them, especially reporting on results and activities.
  - Theory X managers generally don't understand or have an interest
    in human issues, so don't try to appeal to their sense of humanity
    or morality. Set your own objectives to meet their organisational
    aims and agree these with the managers; be seen to be Theory manager
    sees you are managing yourself and producing results, the less
    they'll feel the need to do it for you.
  - Always deliver your commitments and promises. If you are given an
    unrealistic task and/or deadline state the reasons why it's not
    realistic, but be very sure of your ground, don't be negative; be
    constructive as to how the overall aim can be achieved in a way that
    you know you can deliver.
  - Stand up for yourself, but constructively - avoid confrontation.
    Never threaten or go over their heads if you are dissatisfied or
    you'll be in big trouble afterwards and life will be a lot more
    difficult.
  - If an X Theory boss tells you how to do things in ways that are not
    comfortable or right for you, then don't questioning the process,
    simply confirm the end-result that is required, and check that it's
    okay to 'streamline the process' or 'get things done more
    efficiently' if the chance arises - they'll normally agree to this,
    which effectively gives you control over the 'how', provided you
    deliver the 'what' and 'when'.

And this is really the essence of managing upwards X Theory managers -
focus and get agreement on the results and deadlines - if you
consistently deliver, you'll increasingly be given more leeway on how
you go about the tasks, which amounts to more freedom. Be aware also
that many X Theory managers are forced to be X Theory by the short-term
demands of the organisation and their own superiors - an X Theory
manager is usually someone with their own problems, so try not to give
them any more.

### Tools for Teaching, Understanding and Evaluating XY Theory Factors

The XY Theory diagram and measurement tool below (pdf and doc versions)
are adaptations of McGregor's ideas for modern organizations, management
and work. They were not created by McGregor. I developed them to help
understanding and application of McGregor's XY Theory concept. The test
is a simple reflective tool, not a scientifically validated instrument;
it's a learning aid and broad indicator. Please use it as such.
