Locating Yourself



<div id="expander-content-147253788" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

Where are you? Are you above the line or below the line? How would you
know? What can you do to move yourself and your team to spend more time
above the line, knowing we are designed as humans to spend more time
below the line? Fantastic quick 3 minute video I recommend you all watch
to start a conversation with yourself, and your team.

Real eye opener. Thanks to Conscious Leadership Group for the great work
you do. DX is on a mission to create a more self-aware and human world
by creating experiences to motivate leaders and teams to spend more time
above the line, with the empathy our brain is telling us not to.

Team Building Exercises



<div id="expander-content-1258222047" class="expand-content">

## Local

### On-Premise

#### Campfire Stories

#### Rules

1.  Create a set of trigger words that can kickstart a storytelling
    session. Think of words like "first day", "work travel",
    "partnership", "side project", etc. Add them to sticky notes.
2.  Divide a whiteboard into two sections. Post all sticky notes from
    above on one section of the whiteboard.
3.  Ask a participant to pick out one trigger word from the sticky notes
    and use it to share an experience (say, about his/her first day at
    the company). Shift the chosen sticky note to the other side of the
    whiteboard.
4.  As the participant is relating his/her experience, ask others to jot
    down words that remind them of similar work-related stories. Add
    these words to sticky notes and paste them on the whiteboard.
5.  Repeat this process until you have a "wall of words" with
    interconnected stories.

### Off-Premise

#### Scavenger Hunt

This classic team building exercise encourages teamwork and creative
thinking. Put together a list of items for your team members to find.
This can be done individually or in small groups. The first to collect
all of the items and bring them to you, wins\!

##### Rules

Break the group into teams of two or more. Make a list of goofy tasks
for each team to do as a group. Tasks can include taking a selfie with a
stranger, taking a picture of a building or object around the office,
etc. Give the list to each team, along with a deadline by which they
must complete all tasks. Whoever completes the most tasks the quickest,
wins\! (You can even create your own point system according to 
[task](https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-a-task-in-project-management/) difficulty
if you want\!)  

##### Objective  

Great team bonding exercise that helps break up office cliques by
encouraging people to work with colleagues from other teams,
departments, or just social circles.  

#### Team Lunches

It is often said that food brings the company closer and it is the best
reason to bring people together. So why not start organizing a team
lunch session? It is similar to meeting lunches; only thing is that you
and your team have lunch with your remote employees.

The tricky bit would be the time zone\! While it may only be breakfast
for you, it could be dinner for your remote team. Even though it is one
of the most unusual remote team building activities, having a meal
together allows your team to learn new culture and cuisines from each
other and from different parts of the world.

**Challenges**



<div class="panelContent">

<div id="expander-509110617" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-509110617" class="expand-control">

Synchronous and Asynchronous Work



<div id="expander-content-509110617" class="expand-content">

It’s always that  **balance between synchronous work and asynchronous
work**. When people work synchronously, they are online at the same time
chatting back and forth, which is really great for being connected,
bonding as a team, real-time collaboration, and being creative with
ideas.

On the other side is being asynchronous, and letting people respond when
it suits them, not having to be in a lot of meetings, and there’s no
frantic chatting going all the time, so they can work with their heads
down. It’s great for writing excellent code, productivity, having a more
calm work environment, and being able to have manageable hours.

When your team is more synchronous, they’ll tend to feel like they are
more energetic, more creative, and more connected to everyone else, and
they’ll have more sense of what’s going on in the rest of the company.
On the downside, they might feel like things move too quickly, there are
too many meetings, they get left out of decisions, and they’re finding
it difficult to get keep heads down.

When we're very asynchronous, everything’s happening over words and
documents. Responses are a lot slower, and they are much more
thoughtful, because people respond when it suits them. I’m often told
people are getting a lot of great work done, they feel very productive
and very balanced. At the same time, they often feel quite lonely,
disconnected, and like things move slowly. They don't really know what’s
going on with others. They’re all alone in their rooms, and it can get
quite depressing.

Both asynchronous and synchronous communication has its advantages and
disadvantages. In the following table below, we made a high-level
comparison.

![Sync Async](https://codingsans.com/uploads/images/SyncAsync.jpg)

## Balancing Synchronous and Asynchronous Work

Managers always swing back and forth between synchronous and
asynchronous, and I think at Buffer, we're starting to find a balance
where the swings are not so extreme anymore. We're constantly trying to
figure out how to mix the two in a healthier way—what should be
synchronous and what can be asynchronous—and that’s probably the most
difficult thing.

## Knowledge Silos

A problem we're always fighting at Buffer is  **knowledge silos** when
only one person knows about an area of the code base. When they get sick
or leave or something happens, then it’s the whole team’s problem. So,
document your pull requests, write good commit messages, and leave
status on  [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) cards. These
practices make it less likely to develop these knowledge silos.

**Standards**

Setting Standards



<div id="expander-content-424212337" class="expand-content">

## Set clear standards of Communication

Depending on the type of work you do, a daily or even a couple of daily
meetings might be required to ensure team cohesiveness. Mandy Brown, the
CEO of Editorially, a collaborative writing platform that was bought by
Vox Media last year, advocates that remote teams over communicate on
purpose. “On a remote team, opportunities for misunderstanding between
teammates distributed across both time and geography magnify,” she
wrote. Brown says one effective way to ensure communication is to record
meetings so that anyone confused about what has transpired can go back
and look at the record. Communication is key to effectively leading
remote and distributed teams. Setting up the standard for communication
and requiring it be followed will be critical.

## Optimize the right kinds of communication tools

Productivity pros will tell you that the best way to ensure a remote
participant fully engages during a meeting is to talk to them via video
conference. Otherwise, employees will merely call in and then multitask
or zone out while they’re on the call.

These days, offices have a wide variety of communication tools to choose
from, including internal social networks, chat rooms and digital
whiteboards, among others. Email is undoubtedly the most popular but
some consider the least efficient mode of communication. Train your
workers to use alternatives but require they video conference when
working in your distributed team.

Company Culture



<div id="expander-content-1226157341" class="expand-content">

![](attachments/451819861/463532152.png)

You might not have heard of this one very often. Surprised to find this
to be at the top of our list? Having a sense of company culture can make
or break your place as a successful manager. Let’s just say this is the
secret sauce to the recipe of the perfect mix for a great manager.

If you as a manager can align your managerial processes with it to
uplift the company culture; you have hacked most of your
how-to-be-a-great-manager already. It includes all the shared values,
beliefs and practices by the company.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Lead By Example**



<div class="panelContent">

This goes for anyone and everyone, not just for managers — but
especially for managers.

> “Actions speak louder than words,” they say, and rightly so\!

Effective managers ought to demonstrate strong work ethics they wish to
see in his/her employees too. This one should go without saying.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Accountability**



<div class="panelContent">

As a manager, you have to, not only create accountability in yourself
but also demonstrate it yourself. No matter the consequences of the task
performed take responsibility for whatever happens—good or bad.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Sustained Focus**



<div class="panelContent">

Over long haul work, the team’s focus can deter and diverge in face of
obstacles or simply because the project is too long. As a manager, it is
up to you to  [keep your team
focused](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-manage-your-time-and-focus-on-what-really-m) and
their attention converged. This goes especially for any manager running
an agile team with sprint work.

Stay focused\! Get the work done efficiently and fruitfully.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Working Together Works**



<div class="panelContent">

Work on cultivating a family environment among your employees. Create a
sense of belonging to the group. This would ensure stronger teamwork. If
you pace your work forwards as a team with the motto “working together
works” it will make your workplace a home away from home for your
employees.

Everyone’s work would mean to stand essential and they would put in the
required effort to get it done—knowing that without everyone’s part the
project would fail.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Grit**



<div class="panelContent">

Angela Lee Duckworth explains Grit as the power of passion and
perseverance for long term goals and achievements. She counts it as one
of the most important elements to succeed at anything individually.
Since, as a manager, you are in charge of so many others, having a high
level of Grit would always be a requisite.

Pursue your  [short and long term
goals](https://dzone.com/articles/setting-smart-goals-for-project-managers-an-introd) with
your team. Cultivate hope in case of setbacks\! Display courage and
resilience.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Impart Recognition of Good Work**



<div class="panelContent">

Every one of your employees has something that contributes positively to
your work.

A little encouragement from the manager can go a long way. So be
generous when appreciating someone’s work — be it little or big.

Impart recognition and support whenever possible to urge people on with
their great work and efforts.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Grasp of the Entire Business**



<div class="panelContent">

Your employees would definitely look up to you with some reverence and
admiration. You’d be their role model if you have a grasp on the entire
business-related activities. You can easily guide them and answer their
questions with expertise.

Of course, this has other benefits as well. With a better understanding
of the work you are doing for your company and employees, you’d be able
to take your company to new heights. Who doesn’t like working for a
thriving company, eh?

This would display your passion and high knowledge of the field for the
work you are doing, possibly inspiring your subordinates too.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Empathy**



<div class="panelContent">

  

## Empathy

The company or the team you are running is not constituted of machines
or work robots\! As simple as it sounds, it is quintessential to
remember that they are humans. Your team and company are, at the end of
the day, comprised of these people who have very “ *human”* day-to-day
problems.

As a manager, you are, in a general sense acting as their guardian. Be
as empathetic as you can while being an assertive manager. Understand
their problems and try to work with them. This in turn with earns your
employee loyalty and gratitude which would turn to better work for you
later on.

Show your team that you * really* care\!

## Humility and Leadership in Action Then

Recognizing humility in leadership can be challenging to do at times,
especially when looking in from the outside. Still, examples of humility
in leadership abound. Classic examples of humble leaders include Gandhi,
Abraham Lincoln, and Dr. Martin Luther King.

Now, what about among today’s modern business leaders? Because humble
leaders promote team success and performance, they are less likely to be
publicized as great leaders. Even so, look for great companies, and the
chances you’ll find humility and leadership exemplified by those in
authority increases substantially.

Humility is not necessarily the most important leadership trait taught
in school. Similarly, it is not exactly the most common leadership style
among organizations today. Nonetheless,  [humility and
leadership](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/09/14/the-importance-of-humility-in-leadership/#21ac00a52253) are
essential for businesses that want to advance in today’s world.

> ***Bold leaders who embrace humility pursue continuous growth and
> learning. They are authentic and seek the advice, input, and feedback
> from others. They consider others’ needs as priorities—creating an
> environment of respect, trust, and empowerment.***

As many companies have shown, humility and leadership are important
ingredients for business success. Truly, leaders who intentionally
demonstrate their strength through their humility will be the ones who
will most likely be the leaders of tomorrow.

## A Humble Leader in Action Now

Consider Chick-fil-A, for instance. Truett Cathy, founder, and owner of
the company is an excellent example of such a leader. He believed that
effective leaders place others’ needs above their own. Likewise, he saw
empowering others to grow and improve was essential. These commitments
along with a belief in a  [culture of respect and
dignity](https://www.boldbusiness.com/society/company-culture-vital-employee-success/) are
telltale signs of humility in leadership. Because of this, Chick-fil-A
grew to more than $5 billion in annual sales in 2013 and even eclipsed
KFC as the number one fast-food chicken restaurant in the country at one
point. All this occurred despite it being open for only six days a week
and having fewer stores than its competitors.

Cheryl Bachelder is another great example of  [a modern
leader](https://www.boldbusiness.com/human-achievement/fortune-500-female-ceos/) who
believes in humility. Bachelder took over as CEO of Popeyes in 2007
after the company had declined significantly. Immediately, she became
what she called a ‘servant leader’ and shifted the company’s attention
to looking at the needs of others. This decision not only pertained to
customers but to employees and franchisers as well. By being humble,
reaching out to others for feedback and being open to change, Bachelder
demonstrated evident humility and leadership. Within a few years,
Popeyes had increased their sales by 25 percent and their profits by 40
percent.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Unafraid to Make Hard Decision**



<div class="panelContent">

One of the toughest things that fall on the shoulders of a manager is
taking difficult decisions. This is the moment when a manager shows his
or her mettle\! Stiffen up that upper lip and get into it — with
wisdom\!

Your team would look up to you if you are able to keep your head
straight in face of adversary, and a plethora of factors to be counted
in for a decision. Sometimes the decision making is easy but executing
that decision is tougher for varying reasons. But you as a leader have
to do what is right and needed.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Innovation**



<div class="panelContent">

Inspire creativity in others through your own. Practice and learn how to
solve problems with innovative and intuitive ideas. This can make your
life easier and well, possibly for your team members too. Who doesn’t
like a little ease in life?





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Collaboration**



<div class="panelContent">

It could be very easy to get wrapped up in your own mind and ideas. Make
sure to share your ideas and thoughts with your team openly and
honestly. You as a manager have to, of course, keep some decision to
yourself. However, it would be best if you take into consideration your
team’s work, experience, and expertise too.

[Working in
collaboration](https://dzone.com/articles/you-need-trust-for-collaboration-at-work) would
increase your experience not only as a manager but would add to your
people skills too.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Sence of Humor**



<div class="panelContent">

This one is a cherry on top sort of quality. Working for long hours can
get stressful. Having a manager who can add a fun little pun here or
there or make light of a taxing situation is a remarkable trait in
managers.

This will create a more approachable persona for the manager too among
the employees which are again always helpful in running a successful and
well-integrated team.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Esprit de corps**



<div class="panelContent">

Create “group spirit” in your team as you go\! You would have to utilize
a lot of the other traits on this list to get here. Keep a positive
outlook and manner towards your employees and watch it as you, your team
and your company have a fecund era.

Share The Success



<div id="expander-content-134142901" class="expand-content">

You go through a lot in a climbing expedition, but you are never alone.
You depend on your partner or team to get to the summit. You understand
that although you could  *maybe *get to the top by yourself, you’ll
enjoy it the most (both the achievement and the journey) if you get
there with a team. 

For me, a shared journey matters more than the final destination. If
it’s not shared and celebrated together, what's the point? It's like
reaching your best moment, looking around you, and finding out no one is
there to cheer with you. 

The same mantra can be applied to work. There's no "I" in team, that's
why success is something to be shared with everyone. Think about how
much you have accomplished because of your team and you will realize it
far surpasses what you would have accomplished alone. 

And don't forget to celebrate together.

At Trello, we often celebrate our moments during our  [team
offsites](https://blog.trello.com/how-to-plan-remote-team-offsite) since
we are a remotely distributed team. This gives the chance for us to
connect, bond and reflect on the great quarter or year we just had.

When you are in the wild, the problems of your daily life become
relative to the bigger picture and life’s luxuries turn out to be basic
things: a cup of tea, a beautiful starry sky, a consolation hug from a

that you once took for granted (especially when you don’t have any
signal on your phone). 

You learn that patience and persistence are key to keep moving. 

Climbing a mountain is far from being an easy thing to do. Not only do
you encounter physical difficulties, but also mental challenges that
will drive you to the edge.

Although deep inside you are exhausted, you still find the energy to
continue one step at a time—even if it’s going to take several attempts
over many months, weeks, days or hours.

You know the reward will come. It’s like  [reaching a
goal](https://blog.trello.com/team-goal-setting-tips), achieving a dream
and figuring out that you can do anything that you set your mind to
accomplish. 

Have you stopped for a second to take the time to appreciate your work,
your co-workers, or employees? How often do you say thank you? 

Don't reserve your gratitude for special occasions, but make it standard
practice for you and your team to show to one another.

Since I joined Trello, I've been  [working
remotely](https://blog.trello.com/remote-work-team-success-guide). That
shift in my professional life was not easy. 

It took me months of patience and persistence to achieve a good balance.
Today, I see that remote work has empowered me to live the life I choose
to live, for which I am eternally grateful. It also reminds me that I am
responsible for making my own choices—no one else. Just like no one else
will reach the summit for me. 

Smart leaders know not to expect results overnight. Whether is a 
[dragging
project](https://blog.trello.com/8-ways-to-apply-a-new-perspective-to-a-dragging-project) or
a  [new marketing
campaign](https://blog.trello.com/trello-marketing-campaign-plan-ebook),
they have to work on their patience and persistence skills to keep going
and to motivate their team to do the same. 

When you start to encounter too many roadblocks, take a step back and
acknowledge how much you have done to be where you are, and then try
again the next day by looking at your challenges from a different angle.
Where there’s  [a

Nurture Your Emotional Intelligence



<div id="expander-content-2011646692" class="expand-content">

During my all-female expedition, I learned that the cold, shortness of
breath, fatigue, fear, and failure are important to success. 

You can be in your best physical shape, but if your mind is not as
strong as your body, you can easily give up when you reach one or more
obstacles.

Why? Because climbing is 80% mental and 20% physical. The only way you
can work on your psychological health is by gaining experience with
struggle and building your  [self-awareness
muscle](https://blog.trello.com/self-validation-secret-to-limitless-motivation). 

The more you know yourself and can  [manage your
emotions](https://blog.trello.com/9-emotionally-intelligent-norms-team-needs-truly-productive),
the easier it is to overcome your fears and better control the outcomes.

The day of my ascent to Aconcagua summit, I struggled a lot with 
[negative self-talk](https://blog.trello.com/negative-self-talk) that I
was constantly repeating in my mind. That's when I learned I needed to
change the way I talk to myself on a regular basis.

It’s the same process at work. You can have all the hard skills to
succeed, but if you constantly suffer from  [impostor
syndrome](https://blog.trello.com/4-truths-of-impostor-syndrome) or an
“I am not \_\_\_\_\_ enough” attitude while executing your work, your
chances of reaching your goal will also decline. 

Learn about yourself. How do you react to other  [people's
feedback](https://blog.trello.com/process-feedback-at-work-stress)? Can
you control your temper, your 
[anxiety](https://blog.trello.com/hack-anxiety-at-work), or your fear of
failure? 

The mountain is a great environment to work on emotional intelligence
within because you can easily access how you feel about yourself. You
just need to listen to the voices in your head while walking. 

What do you tell yourself? What kind of words do you use? Are they
positive or negative?

Be Open to Change



<div id="expander-content-1791505331" class="expand-content">

If you ever spend time in the mountains, you should know that the
weather changes in a heartbeat. 

No matter how much you plan, things can get out of control unexpectedly.
A member of your team gets injured, a strong wind hits you by surprise
taking your tent through the valley (yes, I've seen that happen\!), a
snowstorm comes earlier than predicted.  

You have to be flexible to change your plans and make good decisions
based on the facts and tools you have in the moment.

Like in the mountains, the business world is constantly changing, too.
What you are doing today, might not be the same thing as you will be
doing in a year’s time or even six months from now. Are you flexible
enough to accept constant change? 

Even though your job might not require you to climb mountains in extreme
weather or bivouac in the glacier, the professional leader needs agility
in times of change and uncertainty. Strength your ability to respond to
things quickly with good judgement. Rising to the occasion in the moment
is a trait of a successful leader and team.

Build a Mountain Of Trust



<div id="expander-content-1872755941" class="expand-content">

Finally, a foundational quality for leaders is the ability to build
trust and confidence within a team, especially a team of climbers. 

You not only build trust in your partner but you also build trust in
yourself. It takes time and experience to trust your feet and your
capacity to climb.

Most importantly, you must trust your life to your partner's ability and
vice versa. You need to be familiar with each other's strengths as well
as one another's weaknesses.

That's why transparency and communication are so vital to building
trust. If I'm injured or sick, I must tell my team. If someone doesn't
master various rescue methods, the team must be aware of that gap and
resource accordingly based on the skills they have. 

Trust is also an essential investment for a safe and productive
workplace that everyone should develop as a leadership skill. If a
leader trusts their team to get the result they want, then there's no
need for  [micro-managing every
project](https://blog.trello.com/how-to-stop-micromanaging-your-remote-team).

Every leader needs to ask a very
important, look-in-the-mirror question: "Does my behavior increase
trust?" If you are considering elevating your leadership skills, trust
is a pillar your leadership should stand on. And trust cannot happen
without these building blocks:

  - Modeling transparency

  - Practicing accountability

  - Talking straight/being truthful

  - Admitting mistakes

  - Making things right

[Harvard Business
Review](https://hbr.org/2014/12/research-10-traits-of-innovative-leaders) analyzed
what goes into leadership excellence, and trust is a major element. If
your employees are going to feel safe coming up with possibly risky
experiments, they have to be confident that you'll be receptive to their
ideas. Productive teams know that mistakes are just milestones on the
road to the next great innovation.

Developing Leadership Skills Outside Of Your Workspace



<div id="expander-content-190406461" class="expand-content">

Many of the experiences and conditions we encounter in the mountains,
and in our life in general, apply to work life as well.

There are many leadership qualities that you can strengthen in the
mountains. Pick the one you think you need to improve the most and head
for the hills\! 

As Edmund Hillary once said:

> "It's not the mountain we conquer but ourselves." 

Every mountain can teach you something about yourself if you are willing
to see it from the top.

Coaching is a leadership competency required of today's leaders in the
most progressive companies. They dedicate time to provide personal
coaching and mentoring that are aligned with job purpose, performance
measures, and fulfilling the organizational mission. People, especially
Millennials, want to gravitate to leaders who will coach them to
success.

Are you having your employees work extra hours, come in on weekends

you micromanage, never allowing your employees to take the reins they

to 
[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/glennllopis/2012/09/10/5-powerful-things-happen-when-a-leader-is-transparent/),
two crucial elements of this plan should be trust and
transparency. Employees want to work for a leader who is forthright and
open. And the trust should go both ways: employees should be able to
trust their leader, and they want that trust right back, empowering them
in the workplace. Implement specific goals and metrics for moving
forward in this direction.

Learned vs. Innate Leadership Traits



<div id="expander-content-292200851" class="expand-content">

Can these things actually be changed? In other words, are leaders born
or made? Are the characteristics of a good leader learned or
instinctive?

## Here are the types of qualities that spring from a person’s natural capabilities

### Empathy

This powerful quality allows leaders to connect with their employees on
a deeper level and understand how they’re feeling. It’s about putting
yourself in other people’s shoes and spending more time listening rather
than talking. When you have this level of understanding, you can make
better decisions for everyone.

### Passion

We’ve all known a leader who is so in love with what they do and who
believes so deeply in an idea or cause. It’s contagious\! And passion
sure can’t be faked. Passion is what motivates employees to go the extra
mile, and most of the time, you’re either passionate about something or
you’re not. There’s not a lot of middle ground.

### Humbleness

A humble leader is one who gives credit to others when deserved, who
calls on colleagues for help, and who realizes that the success of the
company depends on all employees, not just the big boss. Ego is not
something that develops overnight; the level of your ego is usually a
part of your innate personality.

## In contrast, here are the qualities that leaders can work to develop

### Communication skills

An effective communicator clearly explains tasks, deadlines, and
expectations while inspiring and motivating a workforce. Sure, some
people are naturally more articulate or communicative than others, but
being a skilled communicator takes time and practice.

### Transparency

It may be easier to have tough conversations behind closed doors, but
employees want to know what is going on. The best leaders share where
the company is headed, what is going right or wrong, and what needs to
be improved.

### Trustworthiness

If this were an innate quality, we would surely have more trust in the
world. Unfortunately, building trust is one of the hardest things to do,
and it takes a lot of time to foster personal relationships, act on
promises, and show that you are someone of your word.

A healthy balance of natural capabilities coupled with the desire to
learn seems to produce the best leaders.





<div id="expander-324839053" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-324839053" class="expand-control">

Promote Open Communication and Active Listening



<div id="expander-content-324839053" class="expand-content">

People can’t do what they do best if you don’t communicate with them or
if they feel they can’t communicate with their managers. Make sure that
your workplace is an open and comfortable environment for conversation.
In your communication with your team, give your people the information
they need to succeed by being open, honest, and transparent about what
is happening within your organization. Share the strategy, the goals,
and the vision for where the company is heading to show your people that
they have an important role within the grand scheme of things.

Master the art of active and empathetic listening. When employees come
to management with their questions and concerns, it is crucial for
managers to hear them out and address what they have shared. In feeling
like they have a voice that is heard and respected, your people will
feel empowered.

A clear example of this practice is modeled by the culture at The
Container Store, [ranked
No. 93](http://fortune.com/best-companies/the-container-store/) on *Fortune*'s
annual list of "100 Best Companies to Work For." As part of
its [foundation
principles](http://standfor.containerstore.com/category/foundation-principles),
leaders there strive for every employee to know absolutely everything.
While this can be a daunting undertaking for any company, The Container
Store's leadership team firmly acknowledge the power behind this
principle with this [key
statement](http://standfor.containerstore.com/our-foundation-principles/communication-is-leadership):
"Nothing makes someone feel more a part of a team than knowing
everything has been communicated to them. We know that some information
we share could fall into competitors' hands, but the advantages far
outweigh the risks."





<div id="expander-216895147" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-216895147" class="expand-control">

Exchange Feedback Regularly



<div id="expander-content-216895147" class="expand-content">

In addition to providing constructive feedback to their employees for
their continued success, effective people managers continually seek
feedback to improve their own performance. Tim Hird, executive director
of Robert Half Management Resources, recommends managers proactively
request input from employees by [asking questions regarding their
communication
style](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2017/06/05/are-you-a-people-manager-here-are-the-2-skills-your-employees-say-you-need-to-improve/#607769cb6435),
such as “What type of information do you need and want from me?” and
“What am I doing well and where can I improve?”

When evaluating your people’s performance and giving feedback,
communicate to them what else they can do to improve their performance
in their role and offer to provide the support they need to get
there. Successful managers demonstrate consistency between their words
and their actions, as integrity strengthens their trust in their
management’s ability to lead. If you say something, mean it. If you
promise something, deliver.

Provide Opportunites for Growth



<div id="expander-content-886942340" class="expand-content">

Be a leader that commits to and champions a spirit of learning in your
work environment, sending a clear message that the growth of your people
is of utmost importance and priority to your organization.

For employees to do what they do best, they need to be constantly
challenged. They will benefit and thrive from new opportunities to
leverage and build upon their existing skills and to add additional
skills to their toolkit. As a leader, provide your people with new
learning and development opportunities. Allow for each employee to set
personal goals so they can achieve what they feel is valuable to their
career trajectory, and adapt those goals to specific roles and
responsibilities tied to your organization’s strategic priorities. When
managers support their people to get even better at what they do best,
they are helping them help your company.

Create a Newwork of Support



<div id="expander-content-1333396786" class="expand-content">

In order for employees to feel empowered to do their best, they need to
feel that they have the support and encouragement of their leadership
and their team. Effective people managers are willing to try new ways of
thinking and experiment with new ways of doing things. Taking risks
builds confidence and sharpens one’s ability to be decisive. Build an
environment in which they feel safe and supported in risk-taking and
support your people, even when (and especially when) things do not go
according to plan.

Effective management also requires engaging other team members and
encouraging them to work together towards their shared goals. Sharing
information and inviting others to participate in collaboration
establishes trust and a common sense of purpose within a team.





<div id="expander-1250666745" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1250666745" class="expand-control">

Reweard Good work with Recognition



<div id="expander-content-1250666745" class="expand-content">

Effective people managers know the value of telling employees when
they’ve done a good job, and they demonstrate this frequently. Giving
others credit when credit is due and acknowledging their people’s
contributions are two ways that successful managers create high
achieving teams. When managers let their people know their impact, they
ascribe meaning to the work they do. In promoting their accomplishments
within their team, they encourage momentum for further achievement.

In performance-driven workplaces, expressing gratitude is often
overlooked. Thanking employees for their hard work lets them know they
are appreciated and valued. Saying “thank you” takes a few seconds of
time and yet leaves a lasting impression.

<div id="expander-content-707646206" class="expand-content">

The best people managers are those who invest in their employees’ talent
and potential through mentorship and coaching. People want to gravitate
to leaders who will guide them to success. Leaders that dedicate time to
providing professional guidance can help their people remain connected
to their job purpose, performance measures, and fulfilling the
organizational mission. Successful managers provide their teams with the
encouragement, tools, and resources they need to not only do but excel
at their work.

In an ever-changing workplace that is increasingly being impacted by
technology and global markets, positioning oneself for the future is
critical for the success of the company and the team. Effective people
managers position themselves for what lies ahead by staying on top of
their industry through reading periodicals, attending conferences, and
networking. From there, they seek opportunities to share what they learn
with their team members and incorporate new methods into their work
processes.

Agile Leaders Do



<div id="expander-content-1356035359" class="expand-content">

Agile Leaders focus on three things:

1.  they create and nurture a culture in which experimentation and
    learning are embraced
2.  they collaborate with employees (at all levels in the organization)
    to find common values to create a greater goal for the company and
    the teams
3.  they create an organizational structure that reinforces and rewards
    the other two dimensions

![](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/inline-images/2018-11/leadership%20focus.jpg)

## Goals

Providing guiding vision for shared goal setting is, in my opinion, the
most important focus area, and the one that survives even after the
organization and culture are largely self-managing and self-sustaining.
The goals they inspire others to contribute to and make their own are
strategic, and are generally customer or market focused. By strategic, I
mean bold and audacious; both aspirational and inspirational. To
providing contrasting comparison, think about the motivational
difference between the goal of [*landing on the moon and returning, by
the end of the decade*](https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm) with a
more prosaic goal of *improving profitability by 25%*; no one is going
to tell their grandchildren that they helped improve investor returns.

These motivational goals that leaders help us to identify have some
common characteristics: the are motivating and inspiring, but they also
are uncertain; they force us to stretch, to do things we have never done
before. That’s why agility is so important; if we knew how to reach
those goals, we should just develop a plan and march to it. Leaders help
their employees to persist in the pursuit of their shared goals and
values when times get rough and old behaviors want to take over.

## Organization

The basic agile team structure is very simple; if we use Scrum as an
example, there are only three roles: the Product Owner, the Development
Team, and the Scrum Master. But not everything an organization does is
done by an agile team; agility is needed whenever we are dealing with
complexity, but not everything is complex. If you were running a company
that makes paint, research and development would need agility, but the
paint factory itself might be better suited to using lean processes;
unless you’re doing a lot of small-batch custom manufacturing, a
predictive continuous flow process is probably better than planning
production as a series of Sprints. 

The point is that, unless you are a small software start-up, there will
always be things outside the scope of what agile teams do, even if they
are only as mundane as payroll, accounting, tax compliance, legal, and
investor relations. The role of management is to design, monitor, and
correct this system to make sure that the organization achieves its
goals. Even product development companies need to do more than simply
developing the product.

Where agile leadership comes into play in the management context is that
they need to make sure that the different parts of the organization,
with different operating models, don’t destroy each other. Put more
positively, agile leaders need to help the organization optimize for
flexibility and continuous improvement, making sure that improving
customer outcomes always comes first, and that the other parts of the
organization support this mission. But the other things need to get
done, too.

Agile leaders also help teams progress in their maturity. Agility is not
binary, and there are predictable stages that teams go through as they
improve their ability to learn and improve. Leaders create a supportive
environment in which teams can progress, they provide coaches and
exposure to peers who can help the teams learn, and they commit
themselves to improving their own abilities in parallel. [My college Ron
Eringa has written a handful of excellent blog posts about this
topic.](http://roneringa.com/leading-scrum-teams-to-maturity/)

## Culture

The most important thing agile leaders do is to foster a culture that
supports empiricism and learning, and that is constantly seeking better
customer outcomes and better ways of achieving those outcomes. The
challenge for leaders is that they can’t dictate the culture; they can
only create the right conditions for it to emerge. Some of my colleagues
like to use a “gardener” metaphor: if you’ve ever had a garden, you know
that you can’t *make* anything grow. You can create the right conditions
with the right amount of water (but not too much), and enough sun (but
not too much). You can remove other plants that might compete with the
ones you want to grow, and you can protect the plants from predation. 

You can’t control all factors, however, and an organization’s culture
emerges only partly as an expressions of its leaders aspirations; most
of it comes from the people in the organization, how they treat each
other and work together. Culture is the non-copyable *je ne sais
quoi *that makes your organization unique. But while leaders can’t
control and dictate this culture, they can encourage it and cause it to
flourish by the examples they set and the behaviors that they model.

The common leadership behaviors written about in some of
the [bestselling

what is arguably the most successful leadership philosophy in the
universe: [Servant
Leadership](http://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/10-convincing-reasons-to-consider-servant-leadership-according-to-research.md).

If you're new to the idea, servant leaders are people-centric, not
egocentric. Their winning formula is to serve by shining the spotlight
on others.

*[The Washington

servant leaders have "high emotional engagement, loyalty, and
productivity, and outperform the competition daily."

This is not soft-skills, pushover nonsense; servant leaders command a
much higher level of trust from their tribe, and over time are much more
successful.

He says, "We are master self-deceivers. Most of us start lying to
ourselves when we begin lying to others. We wear masks that we want

<div id="expander-content-796541316" class="expand-content">

"What do you need from me?"  That is the most important question a
leader can ask, and an essential one to engage employees. 

Calvin G. Butler, Jr., CEO of [Baltimore Gas and
Electric](https://www.bge.com/AboutUs/Pages/default.aspx), is a model
example of this philosophy. He says, "As a leader, I set the strategy,
select the best talent, and then empower them to do their jobs--and to
do them well."

Butler focuses on three critical things along the way: 1) his
people's development, 2) their accountability to achieve success, 3)
and eliminating roadblocks that interfere with their and the company's
success.

Why Being a Tough Boss Doesn't Make You a Good Boss (and How to Change)



<div id="expander-content-1886649038" class="expand-content">

There's no evidence to show that being really tough on workers helps the
bottom line long term. Try these strategies for softening your approach.

A [2017 review of scientific
studies](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-041015-062539) on
supervisor behavior that bordered on abusive, found no evidence to
support the idea that a tough boss is more likely to get results.

Not only is it a myth that tough bosses get better results, but tough
bosses may be bad bosses. The behaviors that make a business leader
"tough" can veer quickly into harmful choices. This can alienate peers
and chase off top talent.

Even if you aren't a toxic boss, however, too much toughness can be
self-defeating when it comes to employee morale at your company. 

Fortunately, you can change your leadership style and gain the benefits
of a softer, more balanced approach to managing employees and growing
your business. 

## Recognize the strength in being tough without over-relying on it.

I try to remember that "tough" is a subjective standard, but it's one
that's based on certain common strengths. By understanding what those
strengths are, and cultivating (without over-relying on) them,
entrepreneurs can temper the edge that is often seen as tough or even
abusive. 

Some of best leaders I've met have these qualities. Most workers
appreciate the type of boss who makes [quick
decisions](https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/5-tips-to-make-business-decisions-if-you-re-an-indecisive-leader.md) with
a healthy dose of confidence. Whether the decision turns out to be boon
or bust, these good managers shrug and move on quickly. 

Many "tough" business owners tend to take greater risks. However, these
risks must be calculated ones. Rashly choosing a risky course of conduct
without first doing due diligence or considering pros and cons isn't
good leadership. It's just reckless behavior from a difficult boss. 

## Cultivate your softer side

Much of what employees view as "toughness" comes down to the respect, or
lack thereof, they sense being extended to them. Therefore, one of the
best ways to soften up is to focus on cultivating empathy and
compassion.

Try to express genuine interest in your colleagues and employees, both
in their personal well-being and in their workplace experiences. People
respond more warmly to those who express warm interest in them. So if
you're struggling to break out of "tough boss" mode, find some common
ground and listen actively. 

## Improve your communications.

Workers often find bosses "tough" simply because they show their
frustration and annoyance when they're not satisfied with particular
results. To avoid this, first get very clear with yourself about your
expectations. Then you can communicate them more effectively to others.
During performance reviews for example, use constructive criticism if an
employee doesn't meet high expectations.

Always
avoid [micromanaging](https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/4-strategies-i-use-if-i-catch-myself-micromanaging-employees-or-myself-too-much.md),
however. Tell them what you expect to see when the task is complete, but
shy away from dictating how that task gets done. Let your employees
exercise independence in ways appropriate to their position and skill
level. 

## Ask for input.

Tough bosses often don't value input from others. Yet if you've added
them to your team, you should absolutely want to hear what they have to
say. Look for opportunities to seek input from executives, managers and
employees in the form of direct reports. 

Great leaders with higher emotional intelligence don't simply take input
like a human suggestion box, though. Show true respect for workers as
co-creators and teammates by valuing their hard work and new ideas. Look
actively for ways to act on that input when possible. 

## Think about others.

How would you feel if someone looked for ways to improve your day or
make your job easier? Most of us would feel more open to that person or
even consider them a friend. 

You can cultivate that goodwill in your employees by taking the same
approach. Consider what can make your workers' lives easier. This
doesn't need to be something huge, like a large company-wide bonus
(although that would be nice). Look for actions you can take or changes
you can make that result in a positive change for staff. 

I  know one founder who provided a high-quality coffee service instead
of simply putting an office coffee maker in the break room. Another
entrepreneur hired massage therapy students to offer short back and neck
rubs during stressful projects at his company. Even small acts of
thoughtfulness help soften up your image and increase positive feelings
in your employees.

Lead by Example



<div id="expander-content-1910832" class="expand-content">

In the world of sports, the best coaches were star players first. In
order to bring out the best in your team, your behaviour needs to match
your expectations. By modelling the attitude, work ethic and standards
you expect from the team you inspire them to reach their own potential.
Furthermore, being an expert in your field and understanding what is
required to be a top performer before taking on a leadership role means
you are in a position to impart valuable knowledge and skills gained
over time to others because ultimately the best bosses are good
teachers.

Identify and evaluate strengths and weaknesses



<div id="expander-content-122815003" class="expand-content">

Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each individual team member.
Once you’ve identified their strengths, you need to give your employees
the opportunities to use them. Work with them to map out their career
paths, and provide the coaching and mentoring needed to become their
best selves. People genuinely want to succeed, and it’s your job as a
leader to equip them with what they need in order to develop and
accomplish their objectives.  Josh Bersin notes in his article, *HR
Technology in 2018* “Continuous performance management is possible, it
works, and it can transform your company. We’re not talking about doing
away with ratings, rather we are talking about building a new, ongoing
process for goal setting, coaching, evaluation, and feedback.” Appeal to
your team’s strengths and give them responsibility, as they earn small
wins, their confidence grows.

Create a psychologically safe environment



<div id="expander-content-1322241154" class="expand-content">

The human brain is hardwired to detect threats to physical or emotional
safety. Negative criticism generally shuts down the parts of the brain
responsible for creativity and problem solving, which is why giving
people permission to think, speak, and act with reason generates an
environment conducive for high-level work and breeds loyalty. Taking
time to remain connected with one’s team means you have insight into
their needs and are in a position to detect problems as and when they
come up.





<div id="expander-508677166" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-508677166" class="expand-control">

Give recognition where it’s due



<div id="expander-content-508677166" class="expand-content">

Fair, clear, and consistent praise is about making employees feel good
about themselves – this gives them confidence in their contribution to
the company when they feel challenged as well as when things are going
well. Giving recognition when it’s due and taking time to let your
employees know the positive impact their work has on the business makes
them feel valued for their output. Valued employees also trust the
organisation they work for and are more likely to remain loyal.

The importance of equipping leaders in your organisation with the
necessary skills to bring out the best in others cannot be downplayed.
With one boss overseeing at times large teams, the impact of a bad
manager is far-reaching with great effect on worker productivity.  It is
therefore vital to employ supervisors with serious consideration.

Training for Every Learner



<div id="expander-content-841932683" class="expand-content">

Let’s focus on four common types of learners: auditory, visual,
writers/readers, and kinesthetic. Auditory learners learn best by
hearing, visual learners do best by seeing, writers and readers do best
by reading, and kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. While people
may lean towards one way of learning over another, most people will
learn best through a combination of these.  
As I learned through my own experience, someone talking to me and
walking me through a hypothetical scenario did help me to learn, but
still left me with terrible gaps and no resources to turn to. Even if
you have stacks of training documents for employees to search through,
that doesn’t mean everything will start making sense to them.

  - **Written documents detailing a process.** These can be short or
    long depending on the subject matter. It should be properly
    formatted so it’s not only easy to read and digest, but employees
    can also easily search through the document to find the specific
    part they’re having trouble with.
  - **Screenshots or video of said processes.** These are supplementary
    for your visual learners. These back up the written details in the
    document. These are particularly helpful for remote workers. While
    you may not have many remote employees yet, the remote-working trend
    has grown by [103%
    since 2005](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/resources/history-remote-workers/),
    so it’s smart to have trainings that can be helpful for those in the
    office and those at home.
  - **A dedicated person who can answer questions during the training
    period.** Too often companies say, “Ask someone on the team if you
    have a question.” This is a terrible waste of time for multiple
    people. What one person is an expert in, another person may only
    have a basic knowledge of themselves. Have a few trusted employees
    who are happy to mentor and also have time to mentor for specific
    tasks, otherwise, you’ll have one employee interrupting others
    workflow.
  - **A time to follow up on training.** Set up a time within the next
    few weeks after the initial training to follow up with your employee
    to see what they retained and what they have questions on. Now that
    they’ve had time to try things out on their own, they’ll be better
    prepared to ask more meaningful questions or clear any remaining
    confusion.

Make a Smart Investment



<div id="expander-content-1309575883" class="expand-content">

When interviewing candidates, imagine them being a part of your
organization years down the road. Don’t just think of them for what you
are hiring them for, think of them as a leader and view them as such. Do
they have that potential?

Sure. You can’t predict the future. But, what’s the point in investing
in an employee if you’ve trained them up for a competitor? Or, what if
they have the talent — but aren’t a good fit for your company culture?
You’re going to not only have to let them go, but you’ll also have to go
through the hiring process all again.

When hiring potential employees, make sure that they possess the skills
that you need both now and in the future. The new employee needs to gel
with your company’s culture and be excited about your products and
services. You should check their references to see if they are
trustworthy and have integrity.

When you find the ideal candidate — do all that you can to retain them.
Paying them a competitive salary and offering perks that they care about
are prominent places to start.

<div id="expander-control-1003572597" class="expand-control">

Know who they are



<div id="expander-content-1003572597" class="expand-content">

Another way to hold on to your top talent and potential leaders is to
get to know them better. Discover their strengths and weaknesses. Find
out what motivates and interests them inside and outside of work. Stay
connected with them and ask how they’re doing.

Knowing your team on a deeper level creates a more positive work
environment. It also shows that you genuinely care about your employees.
You can also use this knowledge to begin shaping and inspiring them to
become a leader. For example, if they lack communication skills — then
you could show them the basics of nonverbal communication and recommend
that they take a public-speaking class.

Not sure how to do this? Well, you could have informal chats with your
team during breaks. Invite them to lunch or schedule a one-on-one
walking meeting. Ask for their feedback through surveys. And, you could
also have monthly [team-building
activities ](https://www.calendar.com/blog/team-building-activities/)where
you get to understand who they indeed are. You may even get to see their
hidden talents in-action.

Help them Drop bad Habits



<div id="expander-content-332569552" class="expand-content">

“Habits play an important role in our
health,” [says](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2012/01/breaking-bad-habits) Dr.
Nora Volkow, director of NIH’s National Institute on Drug Abuse.
“Understanding the biology of how we develop routines that may be
harmful to us, and how to break those routines and embrace new ones,
could help us change our lifestyles and adopt healthier behaviors.”

At work, you could steer them towards more healthy routines. For
example, you could suggest that they implement a morning routine where
they exercise and eat a healthy breakfast, instead of sleeping in and
grabbing a doughnut. Another idea would be letting them know the
importance of work-life balance by not sending them emails when they’re
not working.

Additionally, you could show your employees how to change their routines
to be more productive. For instance, as opposed to checking your phone
every time you receive a notification, block out specific times for this
action. Encourage them to work on their most important tasks when they
have the most energy.

And, you could also help them break those bad habits that are holding
them back from work. Examples would include never taking breaks, always
being late, making excuses, and preferring only to work alone. You
wouldn’t want to see these habits in an employee, let alone a leader who
is supposed to be setting an example.

“Networking is not only fun but essential to individual growth and
business development,” writes Andre Lavoie in a
previous [*Entrepreneur*](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/242663) article.
“Start small by encouraging networking within the workplace during lunch
hours or at after-work events.” When they feel more comfortable, have
them go outside of your organization by attending industry events.

“Networking will teach them how to forge powerful connections, initiate
conversations with strangers, and act with the confidence of a leader.”
The power of networking can open the door to new business opportunities
and gives your team the chance to exchange ideas. And, “networking can
help turn good employees into great leaders by raising their reputation
within the industry,” adds Lavoie.

Provide Plenty of Opportunites for them to learn



<div id="expander-content-1952244699" class="expand-content">

The only way that your employees are going to develop both the hard and
soft skills to become a leader is through proper training. You can’t go
wrong with tried and true techniques like formal education and training.
You could also pay for them to attend workshops and industry events.
Another idea would be to suggest consuming content like books, blogs,
podcasts, or videos that could help them improve upon their weaknesses.

Personally, I learn best by doing. So, delegate some of your
responsibilities to them. You could also let them take over an upcoming
meeting. You’ll want to be there to guide your employees as they
navigate new skills — but allow them to fail a bit. After all, failure
is often the best teacher.

your organization is a must. Besides being beneficial and rewarding on

your knowledge bass to potential leaders.

As a mentor — you’ll help mentees set and achieve short-and-long-term
goals. You’ll also be there to help them work through any difficulties.
And, because you’re their biggest fan, cheerleader, and advocate — you
can motivate and reassure them when they stumble.

If you don’t believe that you have the availability or know-how to be a
mentor — that’s not a problem. Refer this individual to someone who you
think can guide them — don’t just toss them out.

I’d also add that you must get everyone on the same page regarding

When your employees aren’t at 100%, either physically or mentally, their
productivity and overall well-being suffer. So, if they’re sick, tired,
and burned out in their current position — you can’t expect them to
thrive in their work now nor the future leadership role. It takes a long
time to rehire — consider keeping your employees well, both mentally and
physically.

[You can encourage your employees to prioritize their

preventive care, provide healthy snacks, and encourage them to be more
physically active. Other options would be to show them how to manage
their stress correctly and where to seek help when needed.

Most importantly, I would suggest that you be open about your own health
struggles, especially when it comes to mental health since this will
remove any stigmas. There has been a lot
of [research](https://hbr.org/2019/10/research-people-want-their-employers-to-talk-about-mental-health) showing

Train your employees well in time management right in the beginning and

<div id="expander-control-1656143562" class="expand-control">

Keep it Painless



<div id="expander-content-1656143562" class="expand-content">

As soon as you mention training in a room you can often see eyes glaze
over or glance towards their cell phone, fingers twitching. While
training may not ever be something to be excited about, engagement can
definitely be improved upon. Here’s how to keep it painless and
cost-effective.

  - **Section it out into tasks but keep them short**. If it takes an
    hour to go over before the person even has a chance to try out any
    of the concepts, your training is too long.
  - **Keep it flexible, rigidity is the enemy to learning**. Have the
    essential learnings and how you plan to teach them but include time
    for questions and adaptation if things don’t go how you think they
    will. Geraldine Joaquim of Mind Your Business sums this up best, “A
    good trainer will ‘read’ the audience and know if they need to
    tailor their talk, perhaps emphasizing certain aspects that will
    garner more engagement in the subject. This doesn’t mean they miss
    parts of the core content, but there is no point laboring on an area
    that is causing yawns\!”
  - **Engage, engage, engage**. Out of 1,000 office workers, 33% said
    they wanted hands-on experience with what they were being trained
    on. Your employees will be more likely to retain their knowledge if
    they are actively doing the work as it’s being taught to them.
    Include time to let them try out concepts, ask them questions, make
    sure they are on the right path.
  - **Take breaks and be social**. All work and no play makes anyone a
    dull person, so don’t be afraid to share stories, ask the employees
    about them, and ask some questions after every section or before
    starting the next section. Even though training can be boring, that
    doesn’t mean you have to be too.

<div id="expander-control-954438620" class="expand-control">

Engage Employees with Training



<div id="expander-content-954438620" class="expand-content">

## Make it personal

Typically, making something personal isn’t the best idea – especially in
the workplace. However, when it comes to employee training, the more
personalized you make training, the more likely your employee will
respond positively to training. The best way to do this is to keep the
learner at the center of the training. Pushing learning, especially
learning curriculums that are of a one-size-fits-all variety, is a quick
way to turn your employees off, and even results in an adverse effect on
their work, with time lost and possible feelings of devaluation.

## Ask your employees

Sometimes asking
your [employees ](https://www.lifehack.org/397862/10-ways-to-help-your-employees-have-a-healthy-work-life-balance)can
lead to a dead end, due to the circumstances, office politics, and so
forth. Sometimes you need to intervene and make a decision that’s best
for the company. Training can be like that too. Sometimes you might have
an employee who is good at recognizing their strengths and weaknesses,
and other times you’ll have to step in and offer some guidance.
Regardless of the type of employee, when it comes to training and
self-improvement, it’s always a good idea to ask them first. After all,
it’s important for employees to be engaged. For example, in various
coding classes, there are many ways to help employees retain their
training knowledge, while also being a win-win for the company. This
doesn’t need to be a daunting thing at all. A simple conversation about
personal development goals is likely a conversation that will leave you
both feeling better and it’ll offer clearer insights into how your
employee views their development while also giving you some key insights
into what motivates them and what they see as important.

## Career advancement

If your employee sees a clear path in their professional development
through training, they’re much more likely to be invested in their
training. This can be the outcome of higher wage or even a better
position within the company. In some ways, this is dangling the carrot.
You offer a potential reward, and they’ll do the work to try and achieve
what they need to achieve in order to get that reward. Beware of making
promises you cannot keep, as there’s nothing more demotivating than a
broken promise.

## Multiple formats

The advances in eLearning have been dramatic over the last few years.
With sources such as [Lynda.com](http://Lynda.com) and more, there has
never been a better time to offer eLearning for your employees, which
provides further training without breaking the bank. Combine this with a
BYOD (bring your own device) or a working from home option, and you’ve
got a compelling mix of learning and flexibility that will appeal to
many people. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t offer in-house,
in-person training too. There is still a lot of value to be gained from
learning from each other one-on-one or in a small classroom environment.

## Bake training into the culture

An excellent way to get your employees to respond to training is to make
it a part of your company culture. This doesn’t mean superficially
offering training or forcing unwanted or unnecessary training onto your
employees; it means encouraging people to learn from each other, to make
learning a priority and not a secondary act. Have a centralized
knowledge base, one that is actively maintained and contributed to.
Encourage discussion. Make problem-solving and helping a virtue in your
company, not a taboo. Encourage questions, allow people’s curiosity to
flow, and ask people to punch holes in ideas. This takes everyone to
buy-in if it is to succeed. It’s not a one-off trick and it’s got to
start at the very top.

## Recognize experts when you have them

Sometimes you’ll be fortunate enough to have an expert on your team. No
matter what they’re an expert in, an expert is always a great asset for
a company – when their expertise are used correctly. There are many ways
to utilize expert knowledge within your company, but simply recognizing
when someone is excellent at something and having that information be
known to the rest of your company, is a great way to start. They could
hold a small discussion or a classroom style meeting. They could present
some of their knowledge to the people who are most interested and in
need of their expertise – the list goes on. Regardless of how your
company uses this expert, merely recognizing this person will provide a
boost in morale to everyone.

## Rewards

The final idea on the list appeals to our most basic human selves: a
reward for doing something good. Everyone enjoys a pat on the back now
and then and a pat on the back with a gift card or dinner at a nice
restaurant or a trip to a sporting event are all simple ways to reward
someone for their hard work. These are best presented at milestones, big
or small, and are an excellent way to affirm your employee for the job
they’re doing positively.

<div id="expander-content-1154521442" class="expand-content">

Let your managers know that you expect them to coach every direct report
on a regular and consistent basis. To me, the biggest asset you have is
the undeveloped potential of your team members. The leader coach needs
to develop that potential to the fullest extent. Hold them accountable
by asking for a monthly coaching report, and make that activity part of
their annual performance review.

Train them



<div id="expander-content-1849597214" class="expand-content">

I find that, unfortunately, most leaders are not organically good at
coaching, because talking about tough topics can lead to conflict with
the person they're coaching. Even qualified leaders often don't know how
to handle it, because they haven't received coaching in their own career
and seen it modeled. Training is essential for developing the competence
and confidence to be an effective coach.

Change their mindset



<div id="expander-content-445791658" class="expand-content">

When I was a vice president in corporate America and asked people to
meet with me, they always thought they were in trouble. Why? Because the
only conversation they had with leaders in the past was disciplinary. I
believe there are two different kinds of coaching: corrective and
developmental. An example of corrective coaching is a discussion to
modify an unproductive behavior, like being late to work too often.
Developmental coaching is talking about someone's career goals and how
to develop the skills, knowledge or expertise to help them get there.
The reality is the leaders need to be having more developmental coaching
conversations. That change of mindset can increase sales, increase
productivity and boost morale.

Reward and incentivize



<div id="expander-content-1015176013" class="expand-content">

The reality is humans do what they are rewarded for doing. Put
together a leader's compensation package or provide a bonus for their
role as a coach. Far too often, we reward managers for meeting business
objectives, but don't set or reward coaching objectives. Create a "coach
of the year" award for one manager each year, and generally compliment
leaders for coaching and developing team members. 

The bottom line is, if you want success and growth, you have to coach
the coaches.

**Influences**



<div class="panelContent">

Advancing our careers can be a challenge. Especially, in the banking
industry where the culture and complexity can slow you down and zap your
motivation. Perhaps you don't like the money you make. Or maybe you want
a different role. Or you want to work on more interesting projects. I've
written this article to show you how learning to persuade like an
entrepreneur leads to work happiness.

Research has gathered intelligence on what you must do to successfully
sell people on your ideas. Here are the top techniques they don't teach
you at business schools (unless you are training in my mindset
workshop). If you are in a sales role you will recognize many of these.
If you are not, consider this a peek into the psychology of persuasion.

1.  **Rational persuasion**: The most effective way to sell your ideas
    is to use logical arguments and explanations to prove to others your
    proposal is the best course of action. This requires networking
    within the organization to learn as much about the OKRs as possible
    and being able to show how your approach is the most feasible and
    viable way to solve for them.
2.  **Inspiration Appeal**: Sometimes you need engagement from peers and
    subordinates - to get them on board with an idea - so you can
    successfully complete a task. Getting them enthused by appealing to
    their values, aspirations, and ideals, or giving them a confidence
    boost can be effective. But, the approach will only resonate if your
    audience really believes you.
3.  **Ingratiation**: You don't need to work in cognitive science or
    behavioral economics to know that flattery and praise can get you
    everywhere. The important thing here is not to fake it. You should
    maintain healthy respect for your audience, ensure it comes from a
    place of empathy, and use your emotional intelligence to monitor how
    it is received.
4.  **Collaboration**: We in the management consulting business use this
    tactic when we offer to "show clients how to do something" while we
    work on their project. If the learning is something your target
    values, this approach is a good way to provide additional value to
    your proposal.
5.  **Coalition**: This tactic is about seeking help from others to help
    influence the decision by the leaders you are targeting with your
    proposal. There is a right way and a wrong way to do this. If your
    efforts come across as "ganging-up" on your target, your personal
    branding among executives and management will take a devastating
    blow. The key to this approach is to think like a fintech startup
    attempting to get product market fit and use your networking skills
    to gather insight and facts as well as support for your idea from
    others. Then use the information to inform a more sound rational
    argument for your proposal.
6.  **Consultation**: This tactic is closely related with coalition.
    But, it is primarily done with your target: your boss, or the people
    you are trying to persuade. In this situation, you seek their
    participation in planning your proposal. This helps develop a
    favorable attitude and commitment because they had a hand in
    designing it. This is the primary advocate creating outcome of
    design thinking and innovation projects.

**Be Kind**



<div class="panelContent">

<div id="expander-1056761694" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1056761694" class="expand-control">

Kindness Saves Everyone Time, Money, and Energy



<div id="expander-content-1056761694" class="expand-content">

Hiring a developer costs a lot of money, but the cost of training that
developers in company tools, coding standards, and business knowledge is
infinitely higher. After a year, if your developer wants to go
elsewhere, then it’s a whole lot of money wasted.

If your developer isn’t happy, projects don’t go smoothly either. The
implicit cost in delays to project timelines, code that needs to be
refactored excessively, and bugs that should’ve been ironed out is
enormous.

Keeping a developer who isn’t happy is doing the developer disservice,
too. If a developer has already outgrown the role, then trying to keep
them is like trying to keep overflowing water contained. It’s an effort
better made by simply letting the developer go and finding the right
level of developer as a replacement. Be honest. Tell the developer that
they’ve outgrown the role, and suggest another career path to pursue.
It’s not only good karma to help someone through good mentoring.
You’re also making a valuable connection.





<div id="expander-284581952" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-284581952" class="expand-control">

Kindness Is a Two-Way Street



<div id="expander-content-284581952" class="expand-content">

If management is making every effort to be kind, and you as a developer
are still not happy, then you need to reflect on why. This may be due to
burnout. This may be due to other issues: unclear goals, work-life
balance, personal stress, career direction, etc.

**Developers are also responsible for communicating these issues to
management without overreactions.**

If you just feel “blah” no matter how easy your life is, then get a
mentor. Most development teams already have senior developers mentoring
junior developers on technical issues.

But, if it’s a work-life issue and you’re a junior developer who doesn’t
feel like talking about “soft” issues with your technical mentor, then
talk to someone else who has had more life experience than you. This
could be your parents, your siblings, your friends, people in
programming life forums, or a product manager at work. For minorities,
there are organizations for female programmers, programmers of a
specific ethnicity, programmers of certain gender preferences. Seek
these organizations out. Be proactive.

**Developers and management have to meet halfway. Otherwise, the
relationship isn’t going to work.**





<div id="expander-724478770" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-724478770" class="expand-control">

Kindness Is in the Small Gestures



<div id="expander-content-724478770" class="expand-content">

Being kind isn’t about grand gestures. The small ones are the ones that
are often the most appreciated.

Headphones

If your workplace is a dynamic, noisy environment, just buy your
developer some headphones. At the very least, allow your developer to
use headphones at the workplace. Programming is an activity that
requires a lot of concentration. Keeping noise out and being able to
focus is essential.

Leave your developer alone

Once you get your programmer headphones, stop the product manager from
coming over to talk to your programmer every hour. Put processes into
place so that all details for programming tasks, testing tasks, and
required tasks are documented and ironed out in a meeting. Most
companies just use a morning standup to check statuses and ask
questions. This should be enough until weekly meetings.

Protect your developer’s “flow.”

Minimize health risks

A set of ergonomic seat cushions or an exercise ball are great ways to
relieve the developer’s stress at sitting for long periods of time. At
the same time, healthy food in the cafeteria and pantry and access to a
sports gym are a must. Ask your programmer about their preferences for a
monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Then, get the right ones. Some developers
prefer working on their laptops.

Improve ratios for diversity

Try to eliminate the “I’m the only one” scenario. If you hire one female
programmer, then hire two. If you hire one minority programmer, then
hire two. If you hire one offshore programmer, then hire two. It’s
always better to have better ratios within the same team so that their
social, cultural needs can be met.

Manage layoffs

Business is hard and sometimes there’s a need for layoffs or to hire on
a cheaper workforce. Just call a staffing agency for the developer that
you’re about to layoff. Try to get your developer at least an interview
elsewhere. Developers can also be married with kids. Don’t tell them
they haven’t performed up to standard when they had stellar performance
reviews. Just be honest and say that the business environment changed.
“It’s not you, it’s me.”

Open communication

Don’t punish your developers for speaking to you openly about personal
matters that may be causing issues in their lives. I had a manager who
asked me to take a gap year or a sabbatical when I was going through a
divorce. Her words were, “Your job will be here when you get back.” Now,
that’s a kind gesture.

Mandatory vacations

It’s hard for introverted developers who love to program to go and do
something else. As a manager, make it mandatory. Even if your developer
stays home for a vacation, that’s OK. There’s no right way of taking a
vacation. But, just remind the developer to get some rest. If your
developer comes to you and says they want a three-day weekend every two
weeks instead of taking a consecutive two-week vacation, then see if
that’s possible. It’s not the end of the world for you, and it may be a
big deal for your developer.

Minimize unhealthy competition

On a team, deadlines will compete for your developer’s attention plenty.
Your developer doesn’t need additional pressure to feel bad about
themselves. Try to ask your developers to support each other. Let your
developers be specific experts in their domains. Appreciate them for
their expertise, and use standups as opportunities to appreciate
developers, too.

Encourage humor

When deadlines are tight and everyone’s feeling burned out and
exhausted, it’s time to have some humor about the situation. Keep the
workplace professional, but don’t forget that humor can be used
strategically to lighten people’s moods. Be sensitive to your
developer’s moods. Programming is often a creative endeavor. In
creativity, programmers can suffer from both high and low mood swings.
So, offer a joke now and then.

Good faith negotiations

At any job, managers are constantly negotiating with developers about
time, resources, and requirements. You’ll have to negotiate about
compensation. To facilitate good-faith negotiation, just be open and
honest about your needs and wants. Don’t use “back-handed” ways to make
your developers “submit.” The developer who will give you optimal
productivity is a happy developer who’s passionate about working for you
and the company.

**Motivation**



<div class="panelContent">

## Autonomy, mastery and purpose.

Daniel Pink, author of “[Drive: The Surprising Truth About What
Motivates
Us](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594484805/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594484805&linkCode=as2&tag=thedaipos05-20&linkId=7FHFKXSJF3UWUHF7),”
has found that we’re motivated by three things:Autonomy: People want to
have control over their own work. Instead of being a “helicopter boss,”
give your employees the chance to make decisions. For example, if you
have weekly meetings, at least have your team decide the topic or select
the snacks that will be present.Mastery: Everyone wants to get better at
what they do. Provide opportunities to [show your employees how they’ve
progressed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2015/07/20/8-key-tactics-for-developing-employees/#41f7fa3d6373).
Give constructive feedback, provide performance metrics, and create
individual development plans.Purpose: People want to be a part of
something that is bigger than themselves. Show how their work has
benefited the business. And, more importantly, show how their work has
aligned with their values.

## Offer specific and sincere praise.

There’s no such thing as too giving too much recognition and praise to
your employees. A simple “thank you” note or shout-out during a meeting
should suffice. Just make sure that you’re acknowledging tangible
accomplishments.In other words, you need to quantify accomplishments by
looking at [specific
metrics](https://www.livecareer.com/quintessential/quantifying-accomplishments).
This could include sales volume, contracts/bids won, amount of customers
retained, or increase in profitability.

## Develop a community.

[By building a sense of
community ](https://due.com/blog/establishing-company-culture/)your
employees feel connected to each other - and not just to the
business.Online forums can be used, but you can’t replace old-fashioned
in-person interaction. Encourage your team to eat lunch together. Play
games to go everyone a break. Hold a conference or just throw a party to
celebrate reaching a milestone.By developing a community also influences
after-hours bonding. That’s why you should always invite employees and
their families to events like company picnics.

## Engage your employees in the incentive process.

If you aren’t sure what will motivate your team, don’t be afraid to just
ask them. For example, ask them what kinds of rewards they would like to
receive through surveys, brainstorming sessions, a suggestion box, or
questions during employee reviews.Once you’ve gathered your employee
feedback, you can create clear goals for them to strive for. Not only
will this increase your business’ bottom line, it communicates the value
for employee contributions. That itself should motivate them to
participate in the incentive program.

## Get to know them as people.

What are their hobbies and interests? Do they have any children or pets?
When you build personal relationships with your staff, you can find out
what makes them tick. For example, if they don’t like working late
because of they have a dog, then consider allowing employees to being
their dogs to work.More importantly, when you show genuine interest in
them, they’ll do their best not to let you down.

## Offer flexibility.

Offering flexible work schedules allows your employees to maintain
a [healthy work-life
balance](https://due.com/blog/work-life-balance-look-like/). This is
because it allows them to meet family needs, personal obligations, and
life responsibilities. Additionally, it lets them avoid commuting to
work, reduces stress, and gives them a chance to work when they’re most
productive.

## Stay connected.

Frequently keep in touch with your employees. Thanks to the
proliferation of email, texting, social media, and apps like Slack
communication has never been easier.Staying connected with your team
allows you to offer training and tips that can improve their work. It
also lets you share relevant and timely information like the latest
updates on the business. Just don’t cross the line by communicating with
them 24/7.

## Provide perks and privileges.

Again, work-life quality is important to employees. When healthy,
they’ll work harder and smarter because their workdays are more
pleasurable and rewarding. If flexible schedules aren’t working for
everyone, then give them a chance to earn work-from-home days.Besides
flexibility, provide preferred parking spots, longer lunches, or the
opportunity to spend time on passion projects or tasks they enjoy.
Remember, when employees enjoy their work, they’re more productive - and
that’s great for your bottom line.

## Volunteer together.

Does anything brings a group closer together than spending time sorting
canned goods at the local food bank or raising donations for a
nonprofit? I don’t think so. In fact, that’s why we’re seeing more and
more businesses encourage volunteerism.It’s not only good PR,
volunteering increases productivity, boosts cooperation, and attracts
and retains employees. Just remember to select volunteer opportunities
that your employees are passionate about. Asking them through a survey
is a simply way to find this out.

## Offer the opportunity for employees to learn desired skills.

People get stuck in a rut when they perform the same work tasks day-in
and day-out. When you’re in a rut, it’s easy to become less motivated,
creative, and dissatisfied with your jobs. As a result, you can expect
lowered productivity and higher turnover.You can change that around by
rewarding your exceptional employees with time during the workday to
learn any new skills that interests them. It’s a simple way to enhance
their job satisfaction, improve output, and increase their abilities
that they can use to improve your business.

Self-Preception



<div id="expander-content-366810015" class="expand-content">

How you perceive yourself -- your self-perception -- colors your
interactions with the rest of the world. *Self-regard *makes up the
first subcategory. The confidence and respect you have for yourself
impacts your decisions and communications with
others. *Self-actualization*, the second subcategory, concerns your
pursuit of meaning and self-improvement. If you’re fully
self-actualized, you’ve become the “largest” version of yourself --
someone who’s fully living out what you view to be your life’s purpose.
The third subcategory is *emotional self-awareness*. Being aware of your
emotions isn’t self-indulgent -- it’s necessary for healthy and happy
living. Repressed emotions manifest as sickness, disagreements with
others, constant anxiety, and a host of other unpleasant symptoms that
hamper your ability to live and work at the level you seek.

  - Self-Regard: Respecting oneself; having confidence
  - Self-Actualization: The pursuit of meaning, self-improvement
  - Emotional Self-Awareness: Understanding one’s own emotions

Self-Expression



<div id="expander-content-1128738225" class="expand-content">

Your perception of yourself -- your s*elf-expression -- *influences how
you express yourself. The first part of this is emotional expression.
Once you’re aware of your emotions (as noted in
the *self-perception *category), you must be able to express them.
Healthy individuals can express their emotions and take responsibility
for them without blaming others. Assertiveness makes up the second part
of *self-expression*: Can you communicate your feelings and beliefs in a
way that causes no harm to others, yet honors your desires and needs?
And the final component is *independence*. If you’re independent, you’re
self-directed and free from emotional dependency on other people. You
maintain steadiness regardless of the moods or opinions that are
prevailing around you, and you don’t require validation from others.

  - Emotional Expression: Being able to constructively express emotions
  - Assertiveness: Communicating feelings and beliefs in a non-offensive
    manner
  - Independence: Being self-directed, free from emotional dependency

Interpersonal



<div id="expander-content-135902525" class="expand-content">

The *interpersonal *category deals with how the self interacts with
others. *Interpersonal relationships* addresses how you can adapt your
ability to evolve and adapt all relationships from the meaningful people
in your life to how you impact others. The second subcategory
is *empathy*, meaning how well you can be understanding and
appreciative of how others feel. Without empathy, you can’t form
satisfying interpersonal relationships. Next is *social responsibility*.
This builds on the previous two concepts: If you have positive,
empathetic relationships with other individuals, you can strive to help
the larger community, both locally and globally.

  - Interpersonal Relationships: Able to maintain mutually satisfying
    relationships
  - Empathy: Quality of being understanding, appreciative of how others
    feel
  - Social Responsibility: Developing a social conscience, helping the
    larger community

Pop science claims the average human makes about 35,000 decisions each
day. An emotionally intelligent person can make decisions with less
inner turmoil. The first subcategory of *decision making *is *problem
solving*: Every time we make a decision, we have to tackle a myriad of
emotions to reach a solution. When we understand our own emotional
cycle, we can hijack the approach and improve our decision-making
skills. The second category is *reality testing*. If you have strong
reality-testing skills, you can be objective and see situations for what
they really are without getting caught up in made-up stories, magical
thinking, or worst-case scenarios. The third subcategory is *impulse
control*. In a people leader, a lack of impulse control can do serious
harm to organizational morale. Say a CEO is a sucker for new
technologies, so he invests in the newest and best tools—every six
months. Employees must continually learn and adapt, victims of the
boss’s “shiny object syndrome.” By contrast, a CEO with strong impulse
control carefully considers the technologies available, chooses the best
option for his company, and sticks with it.

  - Problem Solving: Ability to find solutions when emotions are
    involved
  - Reality Testing: Ability to be objective; see things as they really
    are
  - Impulse Control: Ability to resist or delay the impulse to act

Stress Management



<div id="expander-content-62209544" class="expand-content">

We all have stressors in our lives, but we can choose how much they
affect us. Have you ever known someone who flies off the handle at the
smallest provocation -- say, if the coffee pot is empty? Then there’s
the person who lives like he’s in the eye of the hurricane: The whole
world could be falling to pieces around him, yet he retains an almost
unnatural calm.

*Flexibility*, the first subcategory of *stress management*, refers to
your ability to adapt your thoughts and behaviors to a given situation.
It’s how you respond and react in the moment. It’s about the hundreds of
course corrections you make throughout the day to maintain emotional
steadiness. *Stress tolerance* encompasses how well you cope with
stressful situations. Reflect honestly on yourself: Are you closer to an
“eye of the hurricane” person, or a “coffee pot freakout” person? The
answer will give you insight into your level of stress tolerance. The
third subcategory is *optimism*, or how well you maintain a positive
outlook on life. Optimism breeds resilience. If you have a healthy
baseline level of optimism and you encounter setbacks, you have
confidence that things will right themselves in time.

These five categories of emotional intelligence serve as a useful
barometer for people leaders in the workplace by helping them identify
the source of tension or stress. Where discomfort and tension exist, you
can peel them apart and see which component of EQ is under stress.

  - Flexibility: Adapting emotions, thoughts, and behaviors
  - Stress Tolerance: Coping with stressful situations
  - Optimism: Maintaining a positive attitude and outlook on life

**Things EQ people dont do at work**



<div class="panelContent">

Emotional intelligence and the workplace might seem like oil and water,
but they are inextricably linked. Self-awareness and social intelligence
are similar, and arguably quite important – especially at your job.

People are sensitive about work in the way they are sensitive about
money – it’s common to assume that each make moral or hierarchical
statements about who we are. This leads to a lot of self-consciousness,
fear and projection, all of which can easily seed itself beneath the
surface of day-to-day life and make us more sensitive to ordinary
interactions that we may not need to be.

For many, a job is more than a means to an end, it is an identity. It
gives us a feeling of security, defines us as individuals, and offers us
purpose. It’s easy to see why we can often take things too personally,
try to overcompensate, or become too attached to an arbitrary outcome.
However, there is another way to approach some common anxieties
surrounding your career.

<div id="expander-293071074" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-293071074" class="expand-control">

They don’t ascribe intent



<div id="expander-content-293071074" class="expand-content">

The boss had a bad morning at the Q2 budget meeting. A coworker is
stressed and seems short. There was an error in the last memo that went
out and someone should have caught it, but didn’t, and now a supervisor
is mad.

People have a tendency to take things too personally at work, assuming
every transgression against them is a sign of their incompetence, or
worse, how unnecessary they are. (How many people do you know who still
freeze up when the boss asks to speak to them privately?)

“Ascribing intent” is when we assume things are about us when they
aren’t. It’s like the spotlight effect, which is that we overestimate
how much people are thinking about us (this is exacerbated by social
media). It also often occurs as a confirmation bias: if we are afraid we
are incompetent, we are unconsciously searching for evidence to prove
it. Emotionally intelligent people can differentiate their biases from
reality, and recognize that nobody is as focused on them as they are
focused on themselves.





<div id="expander-355961311" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-355961311" class="expand-control">

They don’t try to prove their importance



<div id="expander-content-355961311" class="expand-content">

People who are constantly trying to communicate how busy and stressed
they are not trying to send you a message about their schedule, they are
trying to highlight how important and needed they are. This can also
come out as being overly critical: people who always want to point out
what you’re doing wrong want to place themselves in a position of
authority, even if they don’t have one.

Emotionally intelligent people show their importance because they know
their importance.

They recognize that it is less powerful to talk about how hard the work
is, and more powerful to simply show the end result. They recognize that
proving oneself as integral to a team involves being positive,
supportive, and showcasing their ability to handle high stress. They
recognize that the very behaviors some people rely on to prove their
importance can have the opposite effect.





<div id="expander-1399831000" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1399831000" class="expand-control">

They don’t conflate their whole identity with their job



<div id="expander-content-1399831000" class="expand-content">

The first thing someone will ask you after where you’re from is what you
do, which is a perfect example of how intricately identities are tied to
jobs. However, when this is the case, what happens when you lose a job?
When you underperform one quarter? When you have a midlife career
change?

The answer, of course, is that you think you are losing part of
yourself. It’s this fear that holds people back from seeing their losses
as opportunities to find new or better work. Fear is paralyzing, and
never more so than when you think that by losing your job, you are
losing yourself.

Of course, you existed before this job and you will exist after it. What
you do is part of who you are, not the entirety of it.





<div id="expander-474009616" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-474009616" class="expand-control">

They give respect to get respect



<div id="expander-content-474009616" class="expand-content">

Everyone wants to be respected at work, but few people talk about the
importance of giving respect as well. If you are in the presence of
someone who has been in the field for 25+ years, acting as though their
opinions are irrelevant because you have a hot, new take isn’t going to
go over well. If you want your ideas to be respected, you need to
recognize and respect those of others, even if you don’t agree with
them.





<div id="expander-664003475" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-664003475" class="expand-control">

They understand where their money is coming from



<div id="expander-content-664003475" class="expand-content">

Emotional intelligence very often has to do with basic awareness.
Emotionally intelligent people tend to have a more grounded
understanding of how compensation works, which is to say that they do
not take receiving a check for granted: they understand it’s something
that they have to work, and continue working, to earn.

Likewise, they do not expect a three figure salary at the first year at
a startup, or on the other hand, take a weak excuse for denying a raise
at a major company at which many of their peers are compensated better
than they are.

Yes, your time and your work are worth something, and you should be
aware of that. But you also need to be aware of the company’s financial
structure and understand that you are not going to be given what you
aren’t giving. You have a salary (or a paycheck) because you earn it,
not because you are so invaluable to a company that they would lose
money just to keep you around.





<div id="expander-1842209315" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1842209315" class="expand-control">

They treat losses as opportunities



<div id="expander-content-1842209315" class="expand-content">

Most people are terrified of loss because they see it as a finality or a
judgment of their character. However, it is possible to look at it
differently: if you lose out on a promotion, perhaps you weren’t best
suited for the position. If you lose your job altogether, perhaps it is
an opportunity to begin your own business, or seek employment somewhere
you’ll feel more appreciated. What you lose isn’t a loss, it’s an
opportunity to try again.





<div id="expander-1010656940" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1010656940" class="expand-control">

They maintain humility



<div id="expander-content-1010656940" class="expand-content">

The single most striking and powerful trait that you can harness in your
career is humility. No matter what position you hold, how much you make,
or how well respected you become in your field, if you don’t maintain
your humility, you’ll become immune to the critiques and ideas of others
– which is to say you will stop growing.

There is nothing more insufferable than someone who is closed to
evolving as their field does because they want to be correct. Humility
begs the question: Would you rather be right, or would you rather be
good?





<div id="expander-1178423713" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1178423713" class="expand-control">

They can handle pressure healthily



<div id="expander-content-1178423713" class="expand-content">

Dealing with workplace pressures and functioning well under stress
demands an ability to manage our emotions. People with higher levels of
emotional intelligence are more aware of their internal thermometer and
therefore better able to manage their stress levels. They tend to have
better-developed coping mechanisms and healthy support systems that keep
working effectively even in tough situations. The increasing rate of
change in the workplace is likely to increase work-related stress and
boost the value of those who can manage it.

As teamwork becomes increasingly important in the workplace, people who
are able to understand and get along with others will become ever more
sought after. Highly emotionally intelligent people have well-developed
people skills that let them build relationships with a diverse range of
people across many cultures and backgrounds. That’s an asset in an
increasingly globalized workplace.





<div id="expander-254210735" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-254210735" class="expand-control">

They're Good Listeners



<div id="expander-content-254210735" class="expand-content">

Everyone wants to be heard and understood. The ability to listen well
and respond to others is crucial for developing strong working
relationships. Many of us, though, aren’t as good as we could be at
really listening to what others are saying. Because of their ability to
understand others, highly emotionally intelligent people are in a better
position to put their own emotions and desires aside and take others
into account. Their ability to pick up on people’s emotions, through
tone of voice and body language, come in handy in team settings.





<div id="expander-2003172169" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-2003172169" class="expand-control">

They're More Open To Feedback



<div id="expander-content-2003172169" class="expand-content">

Open, timely, and honest feedback is essential to job
performance–especially at a time when annual performance reviews are
in decline. People with highly developed emotional intelligence are less
defensive and more open to feedback, especially when it involves areas
of improvement. Their high level of self-regard lets them look
positively at areas where they can do better, rather than taking
feedback personally.





<div id="expander-1333545641" class="expand-container">

Collaboration doesn’t just present logistical issues–it also comes down
to responding to teammates’ feelings. People with high emotional
intelligence are able to use their sensitivity to where others are
coming from to build trust and cohesiveness. This allows teams to focus
on the task at hand rather than become embroiled in internal bickering
and politics. Their sensitivity to the needs of others acts as a
lubricant that helps team members work together.





<div id="expander-139219233" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-139219233" class="expand-control">

They set an Example for Others to Follow



<div id="expander-content-139219233" class="expand-content">

Highly emotionally intelligent people don’t get easily flustered when
things don’t go according to plan. And their knack for getting along
with others makes it more likely that others will take note and try to
emulate them. That’s why high emotional intelligence is a key to
influencing people in an organization regardless of official title. An
ability to rise above daily irritations earns people with high emotional
intelligence the respect from those above them as well as from their
colleagues.





<div id="expander-469737210" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-469737210" class="expand-control">

They Make more Thoughtful and thorough decisions



<div id="expander-content-469737210" class="expand-content">

Because of their ability to see things clearly from another’s point of
view, highly emotionally intelligent people are able to make better
judgements about how their decisions will impact others. Not only does
this result in better decision making overall, but it also helps manage
damage control when certain decisions lead to negative consequences.
Being able to judge the outcomes of their choices lets highly
emotionally intelligent people behave more proactively.

People who show an enhanced ability to adapt to change, manage their
emotions, and work well with a diverse range of people are already
valuable in most workplaces. But with the rates of change and pressures
in the workplace rising, they’ll become even more sought after than
ever.

**Signs of High Emotional Intelligence**



<div class="panelContent">

<div id="expander-17666583" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-17666583" class="expand-control">

You think about feelings



<div id="expander-content-17666583" class="expand-content">

Emotional intelligence begins with what is called self- and social
awareness, the ability to recognize emotions (and their impact) in both
yourself and others.

That awareness begins with reflection. You ask questions like:

  - What are my emotional strengths? What are my weaknesses?
  - How does my current mood affect my thoughts and decision making?
  - What's going on under the surface that influences what others say or
    do?

  

Pondering questions like these yield valuable insights that can be used
to your advantage.





<div id="expander-1812493241" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1812493241" class="expand-control">

You pause



<div id="expander-content-1812493241" class="expand-content">

The pause is as simple as taking a moment to stop and think before you
speak or act. (Easy in theory, difficult in practice.) This can help
save you from embarrassing moments or from making commitments too
quickly.

In other words, pausing helps you refrain from making a permanent
decision based on a temporary emotion.





<div id="expander-240074836" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-240074836" class="expand-control">

You Strive to control your thoughts



<div id="expander-content-240074836" class="expand-content">

You don't have much control over the emotion you experience in a given
moment. But you can control your reaction to those emotions--by focusing
on your thoughts. (As it's been said: You can't prevent a bird from
landing on your head, but you *can* keep it from building a nest.)

By striving to control your thoughts, you resist becoming a slave to
your emotions, allowing yourself to live in a way that's in harmony with
your goals and values.





<div id="expander-635924060" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-635924060" class="expand-control">

<div id="expander-content-635924060" class="expand-content">

Nobody enjoys negative feedback. But you know that criticism is a chance
to learn, even if it's not delivered in the best way. And even when it's
unfounded, it gives you a window into how others think.

When you receive negative feedback, you keep your emotions in check and
ask yourself: How can this make me better?





<div id="expander-1994375846" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1994375846" class="expand-control">

<div id="expander-content-1994375846" class="expand-content">

Authenticity doesn't mean sharing everything about yourself, to
everyone, all of the time. It *does *mean saying what you mean, meaning
what you say, and sticking to your values and principles above all else.

You know not everyone will appreciate your sharing your thoughts and
feelings. But the ones who matter will.





<div id="expander-1814605158" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1814605158" class="expand-control">

The ability to [show
empathy, ](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/empathy-the-basic-quality-many-leaders-keep-getting-wrong.md)which
includes understanding others' thoughts and feelings, helps you connect
with others. Instead of judging or labeling others, you work hard to see
things through their eyes.

Empathy doesn't necessarily mean agreeing with another person's point of
view. Rather, it's about striving to understand--which allows you to
build deeper, more connected relationships.





<div id="expander-1645740811" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1645740811" class="expand-control">

You praise others



<div id="expander-content-1645740811" class="expand-content">

All humans crave acknowledgement and appreciation. When you commend
others, you satisfy that craving and build trust in the process.

This all begins when you focus on the good in others. Then, by sharing
specifically what you appreciate, you inspire them to be the best
version of themselves.





<div id="expander-1217578832" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1217578832" class="expand-control">

You give helpful feedback



<div id="expander-content-1217578832" class="expand-content">

Negative feedback has great potential to hurt the feelings of others.
Realizing this, you reframe criticism as constructive feedback, so the
recipient sees it as helpful instead of harmful.





<div id="expander-455399757" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-455399757" class="expand-control">

You apologize



<div id="expander-content-455399757" class="expand-content">

It takes strength and courage to be able to say you're sorry. But doing
so demonstrates humility, a quality that will naturally draw others to
you.

Emotional intelligence helps you realize that apologizing doesn't always
mean you're wrong. It *does* mean valuing your relationship more than
your ego.





<div id="expander-741458368" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-741458368" class="expand-control">

You forgive and forget



<div id="expander-content-741458368" class="expand-content">

Hanging on to resentment is like leaving a knife inside a wound. While
the offending party moves on with their life, you never give yourself
the chance to heal.

When you forgive and forget, you prevent others from holding your
emotions hostage--allowing you to move forward.





<div id="expander-435479662" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-435479662" class="expand-control">

You keep your commitments



<div id="expander-content-435479662" class="expand-content">

It's common nowadays for people to break an agreement or commitment when
they feel like it. Of course, bailing on an evening of Netflix with a
friend will cause less harm than breaking a promise to your child or
missing a major business deadline.

But when you make a habit of keeping your word--in things big and
small--you develop a strong reputation for reliability and
trustworthiness.

One of the greatest ways to positively impact the emotions of others is
to help them.

Most people don't really care where you graduated from, or even about
your previous accomplishments. But what about the hours you're willing
to take out of your schedule to listen or help out? Your readiness to
get down in the trenches and work alongside them?

Actions like these build trust and inspire others to follow your lead
when it counts.

**Ways Manipulators Emotional Intelligence for Evil**



<div class="panelContent">

Organizational psychologist and best-selling author Adam Grant
identified EI at its worst in his essay for *The Atlantic*, [The Dark
Side of Emotional
Intelligence](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-emotional-intelligence/282720/):

> Recognizing the power of emotions...one of the most influential

The last thing anyone wants is to be manipulated, whether it's by
politicians, colleagues, or even those who claim to be our friends.

Below, I've listed 10 ways emotional intelligence can be used against
you. Of course, these actions and characteristics don't always identify
a lack of ethics; a person may practice them unintentionally.
Nonetheless, increasing awareness of these behaviors will equip you to
deal with them strategically, and sharpen your own EQ in the process.

  

## They Play on Fear

A manipulator will exaggerate facts and overemphasize specific points in
an effort to scare you into action.

**Strategy:** Beware of statements that imply you lack courage or
attempts to instill a fear of missing out. Make sure you have the whole
picture of a situation before taking action.

## They Deceive

All of us value transparency and honesty, but manipulators hide the
truth or try to show you only one side of the story. For example,
consider the manager or employee who purposefully spreads unconfirmed
rumors and gossip to gain a strategic advantage.

**Strategy: **Don't believe everything you hear. Rather, base your
decisions on reputable sources and ask questions when details aren't
clear.

## They take advantage when you're happy

Often, we're tempted to say yes to anything when we're in an especially
good mood, or jump on opportunities that look really good at the time
(but that we haven't really thought through). Manipulators know how to
take advantage of those moods.

**Strategy: **Work to increase awareness of your positive emotions just
as much as your negative emotions. When it comes to making decisions,
strive to achieve balance.

## They take advantage of Reciprocity

Manipulators know it's harder to say no if they do something for you--so
they may attempt to flatter, butter you up, or say yes to small
favors...and then ask you for big ones.

**Strategy:** For sure, giving brings more joy than receiving.

But it's also important to know your limitations. And don't be afraid to
say no when appropriate.

## They push for home-court advantage

"A manipulative individual may insist on you meeting and interacting in
a physical space where he or she can exercise more dominance and
control," says Preston Ni, author of *[How to Successfully Handle
Manipulative People](http://nipreston.com/new/publications/)*.

These people may push to negotiate in a space where they feel ownership
and familiarity, like their office, home, or any other place you might
feel less comfortable.

**Strategy:** If you need to negotiate, offer to do so in a neutral
space. If you must meet the person on his or her home turf, ask for a
drink of water and engage in small talk upon arrival, to help you get
your bearings.

## They ask lots of questions

It's easy to talk about ourselves. Manipulators know this, and they take
advantage by asking probing questions with a hidden agenda--discovering
hidden weaknesses or information they can use to their advantage.

**Strategy: **Of course, you shouldn't assume wrong motives in everyone
who wants to get to know you better. But beware of those who only ask
questions--while refusing to reveal the same information about
themselves.

## They speak quickly

At times, manipulators will speak at a faster pace or use special
vocabulary and jargon in an attempt to gain advantage.

**Strategy:** Don't be afraid to ask people to repeat their point, or to
ask questions for clarity. You can also repeat their point in your
words, or ask them to name an example--allowing you to regain control of
the conversation.

## They display negative emotions

Some people purposefully raise their voice or use strong body language
to show they're upset, in an effort to manipulate your emotions.
([Basketball coaches are masters at
this.](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/emotional-intelligence-101-warriors-coach-steve-kerr-gives-a-lesson-in-using-ang.md))

**Strategy:** Practice [the
pause](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/emotional-intelligence-101-practicing-this-one-thing-will-dramatically-increase-.md).
If someone demonstrates strong emotion, take a moment before reacting.
In some instances, you may even walk away for a few minutes.

## They give you an extremely limited time to act

An individual may try and force you to make a decision within a very
unreasonable amount of time. In doing so, he or she wants to coerce you
into a decision before you have time to weigh the consequences.

**Strategy:** Don't submit to unreasonable demands. If your partner
refuses to give you more time, you're better off looking for what you
need somewhere else.

## They give you the silent treatment

"By deliberately not responding to your reasonable calls, text messages,
emails, or other inquiries, the manipulator presumes power by making you
wait, and intends to place doubt and uncertainty in your mind," says Ni.
"The silent treatment is a head game, where silence is used as a form of
leverage."

**Strategy: **After you've attempted communication to a reasonable
degree, give your partner a deadline. In situations where alternatives
are unavailable, a frank discussion addressing his or her communication
style may be necessary.

## Putting into Practice

There will always be those who work to increase their emotional
awareness--in both themselves and others. Sometimes, they'll use that
power for manipulative influence.

And that's exactly why you should sharpen your own emotional
intelligence--to protect yourself when they do.

XY theory of Manangement



<div id="expander-content-577991173" class="expand-content">

A **Theory X** management style may be well-suited for this type of
structured, process-driven workplace. Studies have shown that the Theory
X style of management results in tight control, strict policies, and a
punishment and rewards system that reinforces beliefs. Employees are
initially obedient, but eventually dissatisfied and even rebellious,
driving down productivity and achieving contradictory outcomes, further
reinforcing the belief that workers are lazy and have to be externally
motivated.

**Theory Y** results in an arrangement whereby individuals can achieve
their own goals and happily accomplish the organization’s goals at the
same time. **Theory Y** managers will make different choices about how
to arrange team members and workflows, how to talk to people, how to
reward and incentivize, etc. **Theory Y** managers appeal to a higher
level of motivation on Maslow’s famous **Hierarchy of Needs**,
capitalizing on the human need for esteem and self-actualization.

Needs](https://d2slcw3kip6qmk.cloudfront.net/marketing/blog/2019Q1/theory-x-vs-theory-y/maslows-hierarchy-of-needs.png)

  

## Theory X - 'Authoritarian Management' Style

  - The average person dislikes work and will avoid it if he/she can.
  - Therefore most people must be forced with the threat of punishment
    to work towards organisational objectives.
  - The average person prefers to be directed; to avoid responsibility;
    is relatively unambitious, and wants security above all else.

### Characteristics of an X-Theory Manager

Perhaps the most noticeable aspects of McGregor's **Theory X** - and the
easiest to illustrate - are found in the behaviour of autocratic
managers and organizations which use autocratic management styles.

What are the characteristics of a **Theory X** manager? Typically some,
most or all of these:

  - Results-driven and deadline-driven, to the exclusion of everything
    else
  - Intolerant
  - Issues deadlines and ultimatums
  - Distant and detached
  - Aloof and arrogant
  - Elitist
  - Short temper
  - Shouts
  - Issues instructions, directions, edicts
  - Issues threats to make people follow instructions
  - Demands, never asks
  - Does not participate
  - Does not team-build
  - Unconcerned about staff welfare, or morale
  - Proud, sometimes to the point of self-destruction
  - One-way communicator
  - Poor listener
  - Fundamentally insecure and possibly neurotic
  - Anti-social
  - Vengeful and recriminatory
  - Does not thank or praise
  - Withholds rewards, and suppresses pay and remunerations levels
  - Scrutinises expenditure to the point of false economy
  - Seeks culprits for failures or shortfalls
  - Seeks to apportion blame instead of focusing on learning from the
    experience and preventing recurrence
  - Does not invite or welcome suggestions
  - Takes criticism badly and likely to retaliate if from below or peer
    group
  - Poor at proper delegating - but believes they delegate well
  - Thinks giving orders is delegating
  - Holds on to responsibility but shifts accountability to subordinates
  - Relatively unconcerned with investing in anything to gain future
    improvements
  - Unhappy

### Characteristics of a Theory Y Manager

  - Effort in work is as natural as work and play.
  - People will apply self-control and self-direction in the pursuit of
    organisational objectives, without external control or the threat of
    punishment.
  - Commitment to objectives is a function of rewards associated with
    their achievement.
  - People usually accept and often seek responsibility.
  - The capacity to use a high degree of imagination, ingenuity and
    creativity in solving organisational problems is widely, not
    narrowly, distributed in the population.
  - In industry, the intellectual potential of the average person is
    only partly utilized.

## **Implications of Theory X and Theory Y**

Quite a few organizations use **Theory X** today. **Theory X**
encourages use of tight control and supervision. It implies that
employees are reluctant to organizational changes. Thus, it does not
encourage innovation.

Many organizations are using **Theory Y** techniques. **Theory Y**
implies that the managers should create and encourage a work environment
which provides opportunities to employees to take initiative and
self-direction. Employees should be given opportunities to contribute to
organizational well-being. **Theory Y** encourages decentralization of
authority, teamwork and participative decision-making in an
organization. **Theory Y** searches and discovers the ways in which an
employee can make significant contributions in an organization. It
harmonizes and matches employees’ needs and aspirations with
organizational needs and aspirations.

Behaviour Theory X vs Y



<div id="expander-content-157941338" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

Theory X and Theory Y was an idea devised by Douglas McGregor
(see [article](https://www.economist.com/news/2008/10/03/douglas-mcgregor))
in his 1960 book “The Human Side of Enterprise”. It encapsulated a
fundamental distinction between management styles and has formed the
basis for much subsequent writing on the subject.

Theory X is an authoritarian style where the emphasis is on
“productivity, on the concept of a fair day's work, on the evils of
feather-bedding and restriction of output, on rewards for performance …
\[it\] reflects an underlying belief that management must counteract an
inherent human tendency to avoid work”. Theory X is the style that
predominated in business after the mechanistic system of scientific
management had swept everything before it in the first few decades of
the 20th century.

## Differences Between Theory X and Theory Y

![](attachments/462587555/462587538.jpg)

Motivation implies the act of stimulating or inspiring subordinates to
pursue the desired course of action. It is something that makes people
act or behave in a particular manner. Based on the premises concerning
human behaviour, **Prof. Douglas McGregor** put forward a theory of
motivation, called as theory X and theory Y. **Theory X** is a
conventional approach to motivation, based on negative assumptions.

On the other extreme, **Theory Y** is diametrically opposite to theory X
which shows the modern and dynamic approach to individuals and relies on
the assumptions that are practical in nature. In this article, we are
going to talk about the major differences between Theory X and Theory Y.

## Definition of Theory X

Theory X is a traditional model of motivation and management. It takes
into consideration, the pessimistic behaviour of an average human being,
who is less ambitious and inherently lazy. Authoritarian management
style is applied by the management, where the managers closely monitor
and supervise each employee.

The premises on which theory X relies are listed below:

  - By nature, an individual is indolent and will avoid work, to the
    extent possible.
  - The average individual is unambitious, doesn’t like responsibilities
    and prefers supervision.
  - He/She is self-oriented and unconcerned about organisational
    objectives.
  - The employee resists change and gives the highest priority to job
    security.
  - He/She is not very clever and can easily be deceived.

On the basis of above assumptions, it is concluded that the management
is held responsible for organising resources, for the firm, with the aim
of economic gain. Next, the management directs the efforts of the
employees and motivate and control their actions, to make them work as
per the needs of the organisation. Further, they must be monitored,
persuaded, rewarded and punished, or else they will remain idle.

## Definition of Theory Y

Theory Y is a modern approach on motivation, put forward by McGregor. It
uses the participative style of management and assumes that workforce is
self-directed and enjoy the work assigned to them, in the accomplishment
of organisational objectives. According to the theory, employees are the
most precious asset to the company. Given below are the major
assumptions of this model:

  - The employees usually like work and are natural like play and rest.
    The performance of work is discretionary and provides a sense of
    fulfilment, if meaningful.
  - He/She can deploy self-control and self-motivation, in the pursuance
    of organisational objectives.
  - The rewards in relation to the achievement lead to commitment
    towards objectives.
  - An average worker, do not escape responsibility, rather he/she seeks
    it.
  - The capabilities and calibre of the employees are underutilised, who
    possess unlimited potential.

Based on these assumptions, it can be deduced that management is held
responsible for arranging the resources with the aim of achieving
economic and social ends. Further, the employees are not indolent by
nature, but they behave so, because of experience. Moreover, it is the
management’s duty to create such an environment for the employees to
help them achieve their goals.

## Managing an X-theory Boss

Working for an X theory boss isn't easy - some extreme X theory managers
make extremely unpleasant managers, but there are ways of managing these
people upwards. Avoiding confrontation (unless you are genuinely being
bullied, which is a different matter) and delivering results are the key
tactics.

  - Theory X managers (or indeed Theory Y managers displaying Theory X
    behaviour) are primarily results-oriented, so orientate your own
    discussions and dealings with them around results - ie what you can
    deliver and when.
  - Theory X managers are facts and figures oriented - so cut out the
    incidentals, be able to measure and substantiate anything you say
    and do for them, especially reporting on results and activities.
  - Theory X managers generally don't understand or have an interest
    in human issues, so don't try to appeal to their sense of humanity
    or morality. Set your own objectives to meet their organisational
    aims and agree these with the managers; be seen to be Theory manager
    sees you are managing yourself and producing results, the less
    they'll feel the need to do it for you.
  - Always deliver your commitments and promises. If you are given an
    unrealistic task and/or deadline state the reasons why it's not
    realistic, but be very sure of your ground, don't be negative; be
    constructive as to how the overall aim can be achieved in a way that
    you know you can deliver.
  - Stand up for yourself, but constructively - avoid confrontation.
    Never threaten or go over their heads if you are dissatisfied or
    you'll be in big trouble afterwards and life will be a lot more
    difficult.
  - If an X Theory boss tells you how to do things in ways that are not
    comfortable or right for you, then don't questioning the process,
    simply confirm the end-result that is required, and check that it's
    okay to 'streamline the process' or 'get things done more
    efficiently' if the chance arises - they'll normally agree to this,
    which effectively gives you control over the 'how', provided you
    deliver the 'what' and 'when'.

And this is really the essence of managing upwards X Theory managers -
focus and get agreement on the results and deadlines - if you
consistently deliver, you'll increasingly be given more leeway on how
you go about the tasks, which amounts to more freedom. Be aware also
that many X Theory managers are forced to be X Theory by the short-term
demands of the organisation and their own superiors - an X Theory
manager is usually someone with their own problems, so try not to give
them any more.

## Tools for Teaching, Understanding and Evaluating XY Theory Factors

The XY Theory diagram and measurement tool below (pdf and doc versions)
are adaptations of McGregor's ideas for modern organizations, management
and work. They were not created by McGregor. I developed them to help
understanding and application of McGregor's XY Theory concept. The test
is a simple reflective tool, not a scientifically validated instrument;
it's a learning aid and broad indicator. Please use it as such.

## Conclusion

Everyone should try to become Theory Y.

“A good manager always takes responsibility for the performance of their
team and won’t throw any of their team members “under the bus” while
still providing the team members with all the praise in public, even for
ideas that the manager would’ve come up with themselves. A bad manager
is the opposite. They take all the credit and blame their employees for
the failures, which obliterates trust and leads to the team starting to
also cover for themselves as opposed to working for the best of the
company.”

    - Jesse Nieminen, Co-Founder of Viima

“There’s nothing worse than working for a manager that’s willing and
happy to claim any big wins the team achieves, but deflects
responsibility when times are tough and losses come around. Team wins
and losses should be shared together, with management leading the way to
ensure wins are multiplied and losses minimized.”

“We all like to be told we’ve done a great job, and some managers may
overlook that when leading a team. You should always let people know
when they’re doing a good job, it’s extremely motivating and shows you
respect them professionally.”

    – Matt Reaney, Founder of Big Cloud

“They see you, their employee, as simply a set of hands and feet paid to
get a job done. They don’t ask about you personally, because they don’t
care. If it doesn’t have to do with getting the job done, they don’t
care.”

    – Michael Wilkinson, CMF, CPF, Founder and Managing Director of Leadership Strategies, Inc. and Author of “The Secrets of Facilitation”

“A manager is the one leading their team and will also be the one that
knows when to give credit where credit is due. If they cannot appreciate
instances where their team exceeds their expectations, it will be a
source of demotivation. This will also worsen if the manager does not
give credit to their team while also taking all the credit for
themselves.”

Unable to trust (control freak)



<div id="expander-content-1855650034" class="expand-content">

“There are managers that are unable to give projects completely to their
juniors. The junior will do the work, but everything needs to be
funneled through to the manager for approval – which is okay on some
things, but when a manager refuses to let anything go without approval,
it results in bottlenecks. You’ll have juniors sitting around waiting
for their manager to approve their work, so there’s a huge loss of
productivity. Managers need to be able to trust the people they employ
to do their work correctly.”

    – Michael Sunderland, Managing Director at Full Stack Talent

“Similar to micromanagement, the untrusting manager wants the employee
to get the work done, but is excessive in checking timing and details.
They may feel that employees who are very successful are a threat, and
so place greater emphasis in trying to catch them doing the wrong
thing.”

“Managers that pick out certain team members as their favorites are…bad
news. Often there are some members of the team that are more similar in
terms of culture, values or even work ethic, so it’s easy for managers
to relate more easily to these people. However, when this results in
them promoting their work over others, giving more weight to their
opinions, or giving more assistance, it crosses the line. Other team
members are quick to notice, and can easily become disengaged as a
result.”

    – Fiona Adler, Founder of Actioned.com

“It can be hard to be recognised in the world of work, but even more so
if your manager favors certain members of the team.

Staff can feel really unmotivated if they have a manager with favorites;
it means their hard work goes unnoticed. Showing favoritism towards
specific employees also leads other members of the team to feel
frustrated with the company dynamic when it comes to completing
deadlines and making complaints about those certain members of staff.”

“\[One thing you’ll find from bad managers is\] setting unrealistic

“Dealing with conflict is part of the job description for managers—in
fact, a study from the American Management Association found that 24% of

“Another quality of a bad manager is not caring if their employees are

Unable to listen and respond to feedback (poor listener)



<div id="expander-content-660447776" class="expand-content">

“This is probably the most damaging characteristic that a manager can
have. They won’t listen to a person speaking and therefore they never
truly get to the route of the issue. Instead, the manager hears a few
words and begins to interrupt with a solution, which may not even be the
right solution because they didn’t truly listen to the problem. The
manager with poor listening skills has no chance of having a productive
and effective team.”

    – Cynthia Corsetti, CPCC, SPHR, Executive Leadership Coach at Cynthia Corsetti Coaching, LLC

“The number one thing that defines a bad manager for me is an inability
to listen and respond to feedback from staff. Individual team members
are always a rich source of information – they could hear real-life
feedback from customers, for example, or have insights into where
processes could be refined. A manager who’s too arrogant to realise the
value of this information not only misses out on opportunities to
improve things; They also alienate the staff by failing to listen. As a
consultant who’s zipped around numerous companies for over a decade,
I’ve encountered a great many managers like this.”

    – Ben Taylor, Founder of HomeWorkingClub

“\[With bad managers…\] One-way communication is rampant. In any meeting
they lead, their voice dominates the air waves. They don’t care what you
think, they don’t ask questions, and when you give input, their focus is
explaining why you are wrong.”

    – Michael Wilkinson, CMF, CPF, Founder and Managing Director of Leadership Strategies, Inc. and Author of “The Secrets of Facilitation”

“Bad managers speak more than they listen. When you’re the loudest voice
in the room, it’s easy to forget that you hired a bunch of smart people
who are more qualified to do their jobs than you are. Managers sometimes
consider employee silence to be an indicator of agreement or an absence
of ideas. However, employee silence is more likely due to feeling
uncomfortable speaking. Perhaps they don’t want to interrupt a manager
who leaves little room for others to speak, or they think their idea
will go over poorly, or they don’t want to point out flaws in a
manager’s plan.”

“The manager \[who leads with fear\] wants employees to feel they are
lucky to have a job, and whenever a request is made it includes a tacit
threat that if the request isn’t delivered, there will be ramifications
down the road. This can also include the manager who selects favorites
and gives others the cold shoulder – and will frequently change how they
treat an individual employee. Employees never know where they stand, and
generally dislike any interactions with the manager.”

    – Richard Pummell, Human Resources Lead at DevelopIntelligence

“The old-style “my way or the highway” mindset of management has no
place in modern society, but there are still plenty of managers out
there that try to lead this way. While a fear-based style might get some
short-term results, the long-term negative impact will always be more

Aligning downward



<div id="expander-content-1871650866" class="expand-content">

New managers often align downward because it’s the path of least
resistance. Downward alignment happens when leaders support, collude and
collaborate with subordinates instead of aligning with executive
strategy. For example, there’s pressure from the C-suite to institute a
new policy and the manager knows their employees won’t agree. Therefore,
they tell their employees something like, “I don’t agree with this
decision but …” Downward alignment also sneaks up slowly and happens
when the leader needs support or a sounding board.

**Here’s why:**  It’s tempting to vent to a subordinate who used to be a
peer and a friend. The new leader forgets that the subordinate is also
good friends with other employees. But, sharing private information with
subordinates instigates gossip and hearsay, often resulting in
departmental drama or even [unwanted
turnover.](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247391/fixable-problem-costs-businesses-trillion.aspx) (Does
it really take a white paper or statistics from Gallup to understand
that a leader who instigates gossip is costly to the organization?)

**What to do:** Provide mentors for new supervisors. Explain the dangers
of downward alignment and help them identify examples of downward
alignment. Teach new managers to bring their concerns up the chain
instead of downward.

Avoiding difficult conversations



<div id="expander-content-1248394202" class="expand-content">

When a long-term employee
is [surprised](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2016/06/07/my-performance-review-was-outstanding-and-then-i-got-fired/#1c8645b7190a) after
being fired, it usually because someone avoided initiating [difficult
conversations](https://www.lynda.com/Leadership-Management-tutorials/Having-Difficult-Conversations/746303-2.md).
One of the biggest pitfalls of a new leader is their inability to
initiate difficult performance conversations.

**Here’s why:** Managers don’t want to look incompetent to their boss.
Where their employees are concerned, they want to be seen as being a
“[nice
leader](https://www.smartbrief.com/original/2019/06/how-nice-leaders-create-team-drama).”
Where their execs are concerned, these leaders don’t want to send up any
red flags that there are problems in their department. Finally, many
leaders simply don’t have the leadership development they need to take
initiative. Leaders who avoid set the stage for a discrimination
or [retaliation](https://corporate.findlaw.com/human-resources/retaliation-lawsuits-can-bring-surprising-results.md) suit
in the future.

According to Ashley Norgard, attorney with Kutak Rock, “Usually
employment litigation is the result of leaders who waited too long to
have necessary conversations. In many cases, I see a combination of poor
performance management, ignorance of legal requirements and lack of
leadership, but it usually all feeds back to lack of timely
communication about performance issues.”

**What to do: **Provide your new leaders with leadership development so
that they know how to take initiative in addressing complaints and
handing people problems. Provide them with a good employee handbook and
an orientation from the company attorney who can help them realize the
role they play in protecting the company from unnecessary risk.

Shooting from the hip



<div id="expander-content-31144861" class="expand-content">

The opposite of the avoiding leader is the leader who shoots from the
hip. This leader is entrepreneurial and thrives on change. Although this
type of leader takes action, they lack strategic thinking and often
don’t consider the long-term effects of their decision-making. For
example, the leader changes the work schedule without warning or decides
to upgrade or downgrade titles without considering the culture, politics
or possible turf wars that might erupt.

**Here’s why: **The leader is only looking at the solution from one
point of view. They move parts and pieces around on their chessboard
without considering how one move affects future moves.

**What to do:** Put some checks and balances in place for how much
leeway you give to new or inexperienced leaders. Teach new leaders how
to put contingent plans into place and how to run pilot programs so that
there’s room to course-correct misjudgments.

Misplaced identity



<div id="expander-content-361550113" class="expand-content">

All the above problems boil down to identity. No matter how stellar an
employee’s performance, there’s a big identity gap between the role of
employee and role of leader. The telltale signs of a leader who has not
made this identity shift include micromanaging, having trouble
delegating and feeling threatened by someone else’s brilliance. In
short, they have not made the necessary identity shift.

**Here’s why:** When an employee suddenly becomes a leader, he or she
still identifies with being an employee. Often new leaders are more
attached to doing the job than to getting the job done through others.

**What to do:** Before someone is promoted to a management, supervisory,
or leadership role, start six months to one year out creating a bridge
strategy. The bridge strategy can include many facets: shadowing,
training on specific functions of management, taking courses or getting
certifications. What happens in the process is the thinking shifts from
“me” to “we” and from job to organization.

trivializing your agency in the organization. They’re also calling your

inherent response to these behaviors is appropriate while taking no time

Forgetting/denial



<div id="expander-content-1150118828" class="expand-content">

Your boss claims to have forgotten conversations as they occurred or
denies promises made. For example, if a boss promised a raise or
compensation following a project or sale you completed but then insists
the conversation never happened.

These are just a short list of what someone under a gaslighting boss
might endure. In order to avoid falling into these workplace pitfalls
and maintain healthy boundaries, consider the following tips on how to
productively manage these situations:

  - Record everything in writing and have witnesses when possible. Try
    keeping a record of your conversations via email and avoid making
    spoken agreements that can’t be corroborated with documentation.
    This makes it harder for gaslighters to question your experiences
    and you’ll have a reference point if they try. Make sure to copy
    team members on emails whenever possible and communicate facts or
    necessary information as clearly as possible.
  - Lean on your tribe. When a boss is making you question your sense of
    reality, feedback from people you know and trust is absolutely
    essential. Don’t underestimate the power of a group of peers that
    can provide you with professional feedback and understanding. When
    you feel like you’re losing your grasp, this group will be
    imperative as a sounding-board and moral compass.
  - Trust your gut. Gaslighting takes a toll on your confidence,
    self-esteem, and even your emotional health. This may prompt
    depressive episodes, anxiety, apathy towards your work, or an
    unending sense of being overwhelmed. If you constantly feel attacked
    at work but can’t identify why, pay attention to subtle tactics and
    prompts that seek to undermine or discredit you. Make a record of
    them and escalate it to the appropriate team members when possible.
  - A good example of escalating an issue with a gaslighting manager
    appropriately is talking to your HR representative. If systematic
    sabotage is a reoccurring issue or you consider yourself in constant
    danger of emotional, physical, or mental harm, reach out to a
    trusted resource within the department. Be prepared with written or
    documented examples and think about solution-oriented outcomes you
    can request in your meeting. This will help your case move along in
    a productive manner.
  - Many may suggest telling the offender exactly how you feel, but for
    people who are in a position of power and do not showcase healthy
    emotional boundaries, this may be another opportunity to counter
    your perception of reality. It may be unlikely that the other party
    is willing to do the work to communicate or behave appropriately. In
    such case, another option may be a department transfer or finding a
    new job altogether. Make sure you don’t get caught in an endless
    cycle of having to prove yourself or seeking reasonable outcomes.
    Especially when you’re not speaking to someone reasonable.
    Challenging this type of boss offers an opportunity for them to
    stress your faults while entirely failing to acknowledge their own.
  - Keep the upper hand. Unfortunately, emotional reactions might incite
    the abuser to blame you for escalating the issue inappropriately, or
    prompt them to double-down by alienating you or adding punitive
    punishments. There’s a Polish proverb I find particularly helpful in
    situations like this, it goes, “Not my circus, not my monkeys.” Make
    sure you’re not becoming a sideshow for workplace manipulation. And
    when it’s time to move on to a new chapter in your career, leave the
    monkeys behind.

Sings you might be a Micromanager



<div id="expander-content-486106918" class="expand-content">

### You hover over everything

When you delegate a task to an employee, you’re constantly “just
checking in.” If you had the option, you would probably embed a tracking
device in your employees.

### You're a know-it-all

You believe you can do everything faster and better than the people who
work for you. After a task is assigned, you take it back when you see
that it’s not going the way you think it should.  

### You require approval

It’s great when employees take initiative and jump on a project. But you
think it’s even better that they run everything by you — even the most
basic task.  

### It's your way or the highway

When you assign out a task, you also assign out the “how.” You need to
make sure employees are performing the task the “right” way.

### You're indecisive

Discussions never seem to go anywhere. You continue to gather input but
keep asking questions in hopes of finding that perfect decision. Fact
is, you’re beating a dead horse by doing that.  

### You don't understand balance

You want to keep the project moving, so every task is equal in
importance. From a design’s font size to its overall layout, you believe
an employee must put equal amounts of focus into all parts.  

### Work keeps piling up

You don’t trust your employees enough to task out the work, or you like
keeping the fun, creative parts of a project for yourself. And you’re
wondering why you’re drowning?

### You never stop working

There’s a zombie apocalypse outside? You’re still working. You’re afraid
that everything will go to chaos if you’re not there to lead
(control).  

### Your team is unmotivated

Your team’s production rate is low, and they’re avoiding going to your
meetings or talking to you. You can’t be the one to blame, right?  

### Your team has high turnover

You’re unable to retain employees. Sure, they were bright-eyed and
bushy-tailed when they first started, but you’ve worn them down and now
they’re out the door.

  

  

“A poor manager will micromanage his or her team. They will see only one
way to accomplish a task and will not value the input of others. Team
members are not encouraged to grow, mistakes are frowned upon and unless
a task is completed exactly as the manager wants it completed (even if
completion in another manner achieves a positive outcome) the manager
won’t recognize the success.”

    – Cynthia Corsetti, CPCC, SPHR, Executive Leadership Coach at Cynthia Corsetti Coaching, LLC

“Bad managers fail to give their team personal independence. They
over-delegate and over-assign. Employees who feel they don’t have
freedom will become disillusioned and frustrated.”

    – Nicholas Hobson, Workplace Psychologist and Co-Founder of PsychologyCompass.com

“Controlling your team in minute detail is a terrible trait for a
manager. You should hire a team you trust to do the work and give them
the freedom to carry it out. Micromanaging leads to a lack of motivation
and creativity\!”

    – Matt Reaney, Founder of Big Cloud

“Treating employees like school children is a surefire way to demotivate
your team. The best way to avoid micromanagement is to set up clear
KPIs. If your team is consistently hitting their numbers, there’s no
reason to monitor/manage how they get things done. For example, if your
sales employees are consistently hitting their goals, there’s no reason
to monitor their customer communications or make a big fuss about what
time they come into work and leave each day.”

    – David Scarola, Vice President of The Alternative Board

“A clear-cut sign of a bad manager is someone who jumps in and takes
over every time there is a problem, even the slightest one. If your
employees are resistant to bringing problems to you, because they fear
you’ll take it over, there’s a good chance you are doing something
wrong. A great manager rejects the dependence of the their teammates and
instead asks 'how would you solve this problem if I wasn’t here?' The
\#1 role of a manager is to grow people, and when you solve a problem
for them nobody grows.”

    – Kevin Armstrong, Owner of The Alternative Board – Vancouver

Leadership and Micromangement



<div id="expander-content-2141245650" class="expand-content">

One of the greatest misunderstandings in leadership and coaching is the
term micromanaging. Most leaders never want to be thought of as a
micromanager. In fact, it could be considered an insult or weakness of
any manager.

When micromanaging is used as a coaching or leadership style, it will
most likely deliver bad results, stifle creativity, limit employees’
self-worth, and limit productivity. On the other hand, when a coach or
leader must deal with a bad performer, it is imperative to help the
employee either become a better performer or help them find a job that
is a better fit. Leaders should strive to be coaches who, when
necessary, use micromanaging activities to improve specific areas, but
use coaching skills when getting the team ready to win.

Micromanagement is essentially watching, or making employees feel that
their every move is being watched. Excessive attention to detail,
planning tasks to minutiae, and obsessively tracking the time employees
spend at their desks, on their breaks, etc. are some of the more extreme
activities associated with micromanagement. While this may seem to some
like the work managers should be doing, these behaviors are, in fact,
detrimental and take managers’ focus away from the bigger picture.

Micromanagement has been proven to be a stressful management style that
achieves results only in the short term, and can be extremely taxing on
both team members and management. While there are much better ways to
lead teams and achieve long-term results, there are situations where
micromanagement becomes essential. With this knowledge, and an
understanding of how much pressure the team can handle, micromanagement
can be used as a short-term tool to achieve results when a project is
slipping and all other methods have failed.

**Empowerment** can be defined as the process of enabling (or
authorising) an individual to think, behave, act, and control work and
decision making in autonomous ways. It is not an implementation, and is
only partly a strategy. Rather, it is a philosophy; it is the state of
feeling self-empowered to take control of one’s own future and foster a
culture wherein this state can thrive.

It is important that employees feel connected to the company strategy,
their role, their leaders, and their team in order to secure their
willingness to give discretionary effort and commitment to stay with the
company.

Empowered employees are engaged employees. They have all the tools they
need to learn and grow, connect with colleagues and others throughout
the company, make their own decisions, be leaders, and contribute to the
success of the business. Put another way, empowerment is a key driver of
engagement.

## Why Are Micromanaging and Coaching Often Confused?

Micromanaging and coaching are often confused because, from the surface,
the activities and the leader’s involvement look very similar. The key
difference is the leader’s intent and the desired goals of their
actions. Both require the involvement of the coach/leader—setting clear
expectations, having a well-defined activity management, accountability,
and a huge time commitment from the leader as well as the employees. The
key difference lies in the purpose of these activities. For example:

Coaches/leaders set expectations to ensure there is complete
understanding of what is expected from each employee in order to
maximise productivity and limit confusion, whereas a micromanager does
this with the intent to set boundaries and rules.  
Coaches/leaders show commitment to the team by holding everyone
accountable; on the other hand, micromanagers use accountability to
ensure employees are earning their paychecks (oftentimes, focusing on a
single employee versus the team).  
Coaches/leaders manage activities to ensure employees are on the right
track and that they are in the best position to succeed, and a
micromanager uses the activities to justify effort or discipline.  
Overall, the intent of coaching is to develop and prepare employees to
succeed using the leader’s knowledge and experience to guide them, not
to justify actions.

## When to Micromanage, and for How Long?

Let’s say there is an employee who appears to be unhappy, and their
activities and results are not meeting expectations. The leader should
get involved early to determine if the shortcoming is a lack of desire
or ability, or both. To help determine the issue, the leader should
implement more disciplined expectations and activities and explain to
the employee why this action is being taken, as well as the desired
outcome. The desired outcome should be to either help the employee reach
the expected activities, attitude, and results or help them find a role
that is a better fit. These micromanaging activities should be
short-term activities.

The leader needs to make assessments quickly and take on the continued
shortcomings, which results in moving the employee out of the position.
In turn, leaders should also take quick action to recognise great
efforts and achievements as warranted. A leader should not have to
implement a micromanaging activity for an employee for more than 90
days, and it can be stopped in as little as 30 days depending on the
level of involvement, improvement, and accountability, as well as the
overall attitude and commitment of the employee.

## Trust and Independence for the Team

The complaint that most people have about their current job has to do
with their perceived level of autonomy and independence in their current
role. And what does that boil down to? Studies indicate that more often
than not, it can be attributed, in part, to how closely their immediate
supervisor or manager dictates the nuances and production details of the
work created by their employees.

There are plenty of examples of managers who strike that balance where
they are high-touch, but are not encroaching on the autonomy of their
employees in their pursuit to produce good work. These employers
typically get the most out of their teams—not only in terms of work
quality, but morale as well.

## Here are a few ways that they successfully manage employees closely—without micromanaging.

1.  **Keep casual**, open lines of communication with your team.
    Micromanagement often boils down to the frequency with which a
    manager communicates with their team. If the only thing you
    communicate with the team about is how they can be doing their work
    differently or better, that is a problem. Employees need to
    understand how highly they’re valued; if you’re constantly picking
    apart the work that an employee produces because it isn’t up to your
    standards—and that is the extent to which you communicate—how
    responsive do you think they’re going to be to your feedback after a
    while? Short answer: not very.  One tip that can help keep lines of
    communication open is to take your team out to lunch or to the local
    bar when not on the clock. Show them that your relationship doesn’t
    have to simply be a working one, but that it can be a social one
    too.
2.  **Set expectations** early. Another contributor to micromanagement
    is when there is a fundamental misunderstanding or miscommunication
    between the manager and team members. If this breakdown in
    expectation-setting occurs, it becomes hard for employees to produce
    work that the manager wants to see, which, in turn, opens the door
    for—you guessed it—micromanagement.  So, if you’re able to set
    clear-cut expectations early on, you are more likely to see work
    that aligns with those expectations. It gives your team enough time
    to assess how they can go about achieving the quality of work you
    want to see, and eliminates any guesswork on the part of the team
    that may lead to ill-advised strategy or production.  A great way to
    accomplish this is to hold an internal kick-off meeting before
    embarking on a new project or task. This is where you meet with your
    team and tell them how you envision the final product to look, go
    over any key performance indicators (KPIs) that need to be
    addressed, and address any immediate sources of confusion or
    concerns that your team has. This way, you can create a clear and
    concise game plan and forge ahead with the project.
3.  **Check in regularly**. Having a regular time to touch base with
    each of your staff members about their work will keep you focused on
    their results and will create a place for you to check on how
    projects are coming along, give feedback, and agree on
    prioritisation—and will set you both up well to let them go forth
    and pursue their goals with an appropriate amount of autonomy the
    rest of the time.
4.  **Take on concerns**. When work isn’t progressing as you’d like, or
    a staff member isn’t approaching the job in the way you’d expect,
    talk about it; whether that means giving simple feedback, working to
    develop a staff member’s skills, or tackling a serious performance
    issue or a fundamental problem with fitting the role.
5.  **Trust** those to whom you delegate. It always starts with trust.
    Along with trust, you also have to give the people to whom you
    delegate the chance to do a job their way. Of course, the work must
    be done well, but your way or the highway is not the right way.
    Effective leaders offer and inspire the kind of trust that
    encourages empowerment and productivity. If your group has suffered
    from lagging performance lately, don’t blame it all on your workers.
    You may have kept them on too short a leash, not allowing them
    enough operational freedom to do their jobs, or you may have failed
    to provide the training and tools they need. Worse, you may have
    been wasting time redoing their work rather than helping them do
    their jobs better.
6.  **Delegate** responsibility and authority, not just the task.
    Managers who fail to delegate responsibility in addition to specific
    tasks eventually find themselves reporting to their subordinates and
    doing some of the work, rather than vice versa. And, finally, there
    is the most important and easiest task, but something that many
    leaders fail to do: Effectively sharing your authority requires an
    open, honest attitude, combined with the following characteristics:
    Positive motivation: Use perks, time off, promotions, public
    recognition, handwritten cards, team morale boosters, and monetary
    rewards to inspire exceptional performance.  Leadership role
    modeling: Demonstrate the behaviors you want to see in others
    through your actions. Nothing kills morale faster than a manager who
    demands people stay late and then leaves at 4:30 to make an early
    tee-off time, or one who insists you keep your inbox empty, but
    his or hers is a black hole. The proper tools: Employees may need
    up-to-date training, upgraded technology, or the right office
    supplies. Not being able to do your work efficiently—such as if
    you’re not in “a job level that qualifies for a smartphone or your
    own printer”—is frustrating and wastes time.
7.  **Give** public and written **credit**. This is the simplest step,
    but one of the hardest for many people to learn. It will inspire
    loyalty, provide real satisfaction for work done, and become the
    basis for mentoring and performance reviews.
8.  **Partner for empowermen**t. The final stage of leadership and
    management utopia is transforming an empowered employee into a
    partner. Tom Peters, the guru of management gurus, once said:
    “Management is about arranging and telling. Leadership is about
    nurturing and enhancing.” The leader should be more concerned about
    retention and reward for the “employee partner” and not with the
    product quality. An employee you can trust as a partner allows you
    to move to other endeavors while simultaneously not worrying about
    the company that you have built thus far. Micromanagement has its
    place; partnering has its place. The key is to understand when each
    is needed. That’s the role of the leader.

## Conclusion

Giving up control and empowering your team can be a terrifying
experience for many leaders. You might feel compelled to watch their
every move and peek over their shoulders. But by monitoring someone’s
every move, you’re actually impeding their ability to grow. Give your
team some space, trust them, and you might be impressed by what they’re
able to achieve. I personally think that the future of work lies in
self-managing teams and individuals, where managers act like coaches to
support their team members. If your team members truly feel that their
contributions and ideas are being heard (that they’re empowered instead
of micromanaged), they begin to feel an increased sense of ownership and
engagement.

Autonomy Gets What Micromanaging Never Will



<div id="expander-content-829117377" class="expand-content">

## The benefits of autonomy

> “Autonomy is the antithesis of micromanagement.” — Joan F. Cheverie

Autonomy is our desire for choice. It’s the feeling that we manage our
own actions. And it’s not just about the ability to choose  —  it’s also
about creating the options. There’s little that even money can do to
offset feeling oppressed at a job, as described in
this [Quartz](https://qz.com/676144/why-its-your-call-is-the-best-thing-you-can-say-to-keep-employees-happy/) piece.

When a workplace enables autonomy:

  - **People feel more valued — **Having a say in how things are done
    creates a sense of ownership  —  employees are committed, not just
    transactional.
  - **It alleviates negative emotions — **Neuroscientist Steven Maier of
    Colorado
    University [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181837/) that
    it’s easier to manage our emotions when we’re in control. Stressors
    we can’t control are far more damaging than stressors we feel we
    have some control over.
  - **It makes the job more attractive — “**People were nearly two and a
    half times more likely to take a job that gave them more autonomy
    than they were to want a job that gave them more influence” in one
    study,
    as [reported](https://www.thecut.com/2016/03/all-anyone-really-wants-at-work-is-autonomy.md) in *New
    York Magazine*.
  - **It drives loyalty — **Motivation expands when people feel in
    control, as described by Harry E. Chambers in his 2004 book, *[My
    Way or the Highway: The Micromanagement Survival
    Guide.](https://www.amazon.com/My-Way-Highway-Micromanagement-Survival/dp/1576752968)*
  - **It increases productivity: **[Studies have
    shown](https://goo.gl/VKoJrS) that autonomy makes people more
    efficient.

## Autonomy and accountability

The opposite of control is not total independence. Autonomy is not total
independence  —  it’s a collective mindset that increases team
performance.

Not understanding the critical distinction between autonomy and
independence makes managers afraid of delegating authority. They
associate “freedom” with lower performance and accountability. Though it
sounds counterintuitive, genuine autonomy amplifies both
freedom *and *responsibility.

To help managers and employees see this, we must reframe the reward
system at work. We need to move from a carrot-and-stick approach to an
intrinsically motivated approach. As Daniel Pink describes in his
book *[Drive](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805)*,
we must [focus on three
elements](https://www.tlnt.com/what-your-employees-really-want-and-how-you-can-give-it-to-them/):
Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose.

As Pink explains, our brains are wired to self-direct. We don’t want
others telling us how to do things; we want to feel in control. We need
to have autonomy over our tasks (what we do), our time (when we do it),
the team (who we do it with), and the technique (how we do it). Spotify,
for example, is organized in small cross-functional teams known as
“[Squads](https://medium.com/project-management-learnings/spotify-squad-framework-part-i-8f74bcfcd761)”
 —  each has the autonomy to decide****what to build, how to build it,
and how to work together.

Autonomy and accountability are not opposing forces that must be
balanced. Promoting autonomy encourages people to become more
accountable to themselves and others. It creates a virtuous cycle.

## Belonging drives accountability

> “Great leaders don’t want the attention, but they use it. They use it
> to unite the tribe and to reinforce its sense of purpose.” —
> Seth Godin

We are social animals. Our culture is shaped by the groups, or tribes,
we belong to. In his
book *[Tribes](https://www.amazon.com/Tribes-We-Need-You-Lead/dp/1491514736)*,
Seth Godin defines a “tribe” as a group of people who share interests
and communication styles. Members of a tribe are connected to one
another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea.

Great teams are like tribes. People want to connect with a leader and an
idea . They want to join a mission, not just a job, as I
wrote [here](https://www.tlnt.com/hire-for-a-mission-not-a-job/).
People want connection and growth. They want to be accountable to
something larger than themselves.

When teams behave like tribes, they increase their chances of success.
They become tighter and more fluid entities. They become great at
recruiting and immersing newcomers. They also become skilled at
identifying and rejecting those who lower the bar.

Spotify’s “Squads” define their own missions, develop their own goals,
and how they work  —  they are tribes with end-to-end responsibilities.

Godin describes how great leadership creates the conditions for tribes
to form and thrive: “A leader can help increase the effectiveness of the
tribe and its members by transforming the shared interest into a
passionate goal and desire for change; providing tools to allow members
to tighten their communications; and leveraging the tribe to allow it to
grow and gain new members.”

When a team becomes a tribe, the role of the leader doesn’t lose
importance — it evolves into something much more meaningful.

## Getting started

How managers introduce a challenge or kick off a new project can
encourage the *feeling* of autonomy, or hinder it  —  and perception
matters as much as reality.

Here are some tips for leaders who want to [foster strong, autonomous
tribes](https://www.tlnt.com/four-steps-to-creating-a-supportive-culture-of-employee-autonomy/):

  - **Recognize that your job is to lead *people*, not to manage
    tasks.**You must [work through
    others](https://www.tlnt.com/how-to-follow-up-without-being-a-pain-in-the-rear-micromanager/) to
    accomplish a mission.
  - **Start small. **Promising full autonomy and then cutting back on
    “freedom” not only backfires,  it erodes trust and credibility.
    It’s always better to surprise than to overpromise.
  - **Set expectations up front**. For every project, be clear on what
    you want to achieve and on the rules of engagement. What’s the
    mission? How much accountability will the team have? Will they need
    to check in with you at certain stages? If you have doubts or fears,
    share those with your team  —  change is navigating uncertainty.
    People expect leaders to be honest, not to be perfect.
  - **Be patient.**It takes time for a team to turn into a
    high-performing tribe. People sometimes turn into “dictators” when
    they receive more power ;  through time, they’ll find balance. Be
    ready for some chaos at the beginning of the process.
  - **Reframe mistakes as learning moments. **To experiment with “new
    ways of crossing the river,” people must make mistakes. Create a
    habit of [turning errors into
    lessons](https://www.tlnt.com/the-powerful-and-lasting-lessons-you-get-from-failure/).
    At WD-40, mistakes are called “[learning
    moments](http://marciaconner.com/dl/ridge-primer-p12-15.pdf)”  —
     they can be positive or negative, but are never considered bad.
    Employees openly and freely share mistakes because they understand
    that though mistakes come and go, learning is forever.
  - **Promote collective autonomy. **Providing people with more freedom
    to speak and make choices doesn’t mean they’ll do what they want.
    It’s always about what’s better for the tribe, not for a
    particular individual.
  - **Focus on the mission. **[Leading
    change](https://www.tlnt.com/6-essential-leadership-responsibilities-that-build-effective-teams/) by
    delegating authority involves specifying the desired outcome,
    putting a team in charge, and letting them design a way to get
    there. Challenge your team to find a way to cross the river rather
    than asking them to build a bridge.
  - **Focus on accountability, not just goals. **Autonomy and
    accountability are two sides of the same coin. Expectations for each
    role must be clear and aligned with the distributed authority. In
    Holacracy, a self-management practice, accountability usually begins
    with an -ing verb to convey that it’s an ongoing activity (and not a
    one-time project or action). [Check out this
    post ](https://blog.holacracy.org/writing-roles-accountabilities-in-holacracy-eb9d83e363bf)on
    for more on crafting accountabilities.
  - **Set level expectations.**Clarity is critical. Educate your team on
    the power of autonomy and how to implement it throughout your
    organization. Most importantly, focus on the *why*: What are you
    trying to achieve?
  - **Simplify your rules. **Most organizations build their policies
    with a micromanagement mindset. Take a close look at both your
    employee handbook and the unwritten rules you mention in meetings.
    Is everything forbidden unless it is permitted? Or is it everything
    allowed unless it’s forbidden? General Motors’ CEO narrowed down its
    dress code policy to [just two
    words](https://work.qz.com/1242801/gms-dress-code-is-only-two-words/):
    “dress accordingly.”
  - **Include your team along the way. **Promoting autonomy with a
    top-down approach would be ironic. Your team should be involved from
    the beginning, especially when setting up expectations, clarifying
    the problem to be fixed, and aligning on the ideal outcome. Early
    involvement not only minimizes resistance and noise down the line,
    it promotes ownership.

Autonomy is more rewarding than money. People want to join a mission and
become part of a tribe, not to be told how**to work. They want to be the
source of their own action.

Letting go of power may make many leaders nervous, but micromanagement
is what really hinders an organization’s potential. It cannot be scaled.
The same applies when implementing autonomy at your company: there’s no
universal solution, no one-size-fits-all method for developing strong,
agile, high-functioning tribes. Every company must find its own way.

Negatively Affects of Micromanagement



<div id="expander-content-935838722" class="expand-content">

## Decreased Productivity

Constant surveillance along with excessive tweaking and input decrease
productivity. Employees have to slow down in their work to process and
implement the continuous input and changes to their workflow. It can
also lead them to second-guess their ability to complete tasks
independently. This results in a staff that becomes dependent on their
manager for guidance in completing their work. Micromanagers essentially
retain all of the authority employees need to take responsibility for
doing their jobs. They also risk losing the advantages of their
employees’ unique insights, skills, and talents because they have
conditioned them to only do what they are told to do. People who
micromanage also forgo opportunities to help their organizations more
because they are putting more time into the lower level jobs of their
employees instead of the more important work for which they are
responsible.

## Increased Employee Turnover

Chronic micromanagement often leads people to quit their jobs. It
destroys the manager/ employee relationship. The persistent monitoring
of everything they do, repetitively going over every element of their
job, and redoing their work the way the micromanager would do it drains
talented employees and sends them looking for work elsewhere. The
momentum of the department decreases due to constant training and
re-training staff. The time, effort, and resources required to hire and
train replacements negatively impacts the company’s bottom line as well.

## Morale is Lowered

When micromanaged, employees begin to feel a loss of autonomy. When this
happens, they’ll slowly lose the desire to go the extra mile for a task
and taking pride in what they do. They’ll limit themselves to what is
demanded from their manager. Essentially, they stop trying, and their
engagement levels fall. Micromanagers unintentionally or intentionally
discourage others from making decisions by pushing aside the experience
and knowledge of their employees when they take control over their work.

## Loss of Trust

Micromanagement destroys trust. Employees should feel trusted and valued
by their manager and organization especially when it comes to doing
their job. When micromanagers stifle an employee’s decision-making, it
gives the employee the impression that the manager doesn’t trust them or
believe in their abilities enough to complete the task at hand.
Micromanagers can make employees feel powerless, unable to use their own
resources, knowledge, and initiative to figure things out. Without
trust, employees become resentful and disloyal. They either take their
talents to another company or they stay and become deadweight, waiting
for their manager’s instructions.

## Teamwork Is Destroyed

A micromanaged workplace discourages teamwork as employees work less
with each other and more or only with the micromanager. This can make
employees feel undervalued and unappreciated. Teamwork creates synergy,
empowers, and promotes better communication to achieve goals faster.
Micromanagers undermine teamwork through their refusal or inability to
delegate and their knack for criticizing and immersing themselves in the
work of others. Their actions suppress creativity and insult the talent
of their employees.  The organization as a whole misses out on the
benefits of having a highly effective team that is also collaborative
and creatively solves problems.

## Reduced Innovation

Employee engagement drives innovation, and empowering employees helps
increase engagement rates. Micromanagement disempowers employees by not
allowing them to get results in ways that work for them. This makes them
feel less accountable for their results and less engaged. Micromanagers
underutilize their employees’ skills, knowledge, and talent by
controlling their every movement. They leave no room for employees to
critique and improve their own processes to develop their expertise.
When micromanagers treat their employees as order-takers, they diminish
their capacity to innovate. Demanding creativity while jumping in to
make decisions and adding pressure to work a certain way does not create
a work environment conducive to innovation.

## Health Problems Arise

Micromanagers over time exert a heavy toll on their employees’ health.
Micromanagement increases employee stress that can affect both work and
home life. An employee who has a hard time at work may give family and
friends a hard time outside of work, thus damaging those relationships.
It can also drive employees to smoke, drink, and overeat. This in turn
leads to other health issues such as increased risk of heart attack,
high blood pressure, and sleep problems. Employees whose manager is
verbally or emotionally abusive experience emotional strain and lowered
self-esteem. Being controlled at work without the ability to make
decisions makes employees more likely to become depressed.

## Wrapping It All Up

Managers should exercise control with clear direction and guidance for
employees to follow. Once their employees learn their duties and
responsibilities, they should be encouraged to perform their job
independently while asking questions as needed to perform tasks. Through
this process, employees are learning to be capable, confident and
independent. Job satisfaction, creativity and morale increase. While
some attributes of micromanaging may be necessary to perform certain
duties in the workplace, they do not offer any benefits to productivity
or employee engagement.

**How to Effectively Lead Remote IT Teams**



<div class="panelContent">

  - In order to build trust and bond with someone you really need to go
    and arrange a meeting – it is our ape-brain that always says that a
    new person that you've never met is most probably a threat to your
    well being.
  - Make sure you do a thorough interview before bringing someone new in
    the team. You can use different tools like hacker rank to check
    their IT skills.
  - With good on boarding, you can get twice the employee engagement in
    just one hour. It turns out it is far better to ask the newcomer
    about them and let them talk.
  - The last thing you want is people who feel restricted to ask
    questions, propose new ideas or experiment with better solutions.
  - The best measure of team collaboration is how many times team
    members interact. If you are not at the same office, make sure you
    design special meetings for interactions.

If you are about to build a software product or implement a digital
platform, then there are many things you need to consider – like product
design, technology stack, architecture and so on. And many times we
forget, that at the end the most crucial part is the team that will
deliver it.

Many people think that selecting proven experts and giving them а pile
of cash is enough to reach success.  However, history has proven that’s
not the case – there are many multi-million dollar companies that have
big cash cushion and can afford all the talent and yet they've lost the
race to a small competitor. Take the example of Overture – a company
with 1b valuation that got out competed by Google's Ads, which was a
startup at that time. Or the example of one Swedish broadcasting group
that did not spare money to hire the most brilliant names in media but
finally failed to create a streaming service that could compete with
Netflix.

In his book [The Culture
Code](https://www.amazon.com/Culture-Code-Secrets-Highly-Successful/dp/0525492461),
Daniel Coyle makes a deep dive into what makes some teams extremely
efficient and why others fail miserably. And much of his researches
shows that the most critical part in delivering successful product is
the team, team dynamics and team culture.

For the past 13 years running my custom software
development [company](https://dreamix.eu/), I’ve been involved in
forming many product development teams. Most of them have been
distributed and in this article I outline what are the risks and how to
solve them when working with distributed teams.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**It all Starts with Creating a Real Bond**



<div class="panelContent">

You always need to build trust first and to bond with someone new you
really need to go and do a live meeting – it is our ape-brain that
always says that a new person that you've never met is most probably a
threat to your well being. That is until you meet, have a fireside chat,
tell each other’s story and drink a couple of beers. Then we have the
opportunity to find all the similar experiences and preferences we share
and also discuss our weaknesses, which in fact creates an even stronger
bond.

This is also the reason why we start each of our new partnerships with
either a visit to our partner's office or we welcome them yo ours.
Because forming this initial bond is what drives us through the
challenges of the projects that are yet to come.

### Encourage Transparency

As a manager/leader, you also need to lead by example. You can’t expect
your remote workers to open up, get to know you and each other or
discuss projects and share their opinion, if you don’t do that yourself.

Be transparent. Get them involved in all aspects of the business, share
with them the company vision and objectives, let them resonate with
that. Then, set clear expectations, tell them some things about yourself
and let them talk about something other than work too.

That’s when virtual meetings come in handy.

### Hold Regular Meetings

This is one of the challenges of working with a remote team as
everyone’s in a different time zone. But you can do it.

The only way to understand what kind of people you have on the team is
to meet at least once a week and just create a friendly and honest
environment where everyone can talk about anything. Consider it virtual
coffee and even call it that way.

There are many benefits to virtual meetings. It doesn’t matter if the
remote workers are traveling, at home, at a co-working space or in a
office. The point is to sign in the software you’re using for such
meetings and relax for the next half an hour or so.

Over time, you’ll connect with each other and will feel more like a
team.

### Organize Your Work

A proper structure is what boosts any business. Managing people across
the globe without knowing what everyone’s working on and having many
projects on your hands can easily turn work into chaos. That’s why you
need to create procedures and implement [project management
systems](https://www.actitime.com/productivity-tools/project-management-tools?source=post_page---------------------------),
set rules and share them with everyone on the team.

For a start, organize all the data, categorize it, and make it available
to all team members. Decide on the communication style for each
situation. For example, you can email each other for things that can
wait, but can also use a chat room that’s open 24/7 if something urgent
comes up.

Set clear deadlines and make sure everyone knows the next steps on the
project. Make use of the collaboration and sharing options that [project
management tools
offer](https://www.actitime.com/features-in-detail/project-and-task-management?source=post_page---------------------------) so
you can see what others are working on and what’s left to be done.

### Use a Time Tracking Tool

Another thing you need in your arsenal is a [time-tracking
tool](https://www.actitime.com/time-tracking/what-is-time-tracking?source=post_page---------------------------).
This is an efficient way to keep your employees on track, review their
performance, set clear objectives, and increase team productivity.

Be sure to introduce the new piece of technology to your team and let
your colleagues know how they can use it to their advantage. They should
understand that it will help them manage their time better too and thus
not waste any of it, so it’s a win-win situation.

Timesheet software will help workers be mindful about the time they
spend on their tasks, which improves concentration and fights
distractions. Also, time tracking tools eliminate the pain of
accurate [payroll
calculation](https://www.actitime.com/features-in-detail/project-cost-and-client-billing?source=post_page---------------------------).
You’ll never over- or underpay anyone when you have exact data of their
work time expenses.

The main benefit of special time-tracking tools for remote teams is that
every employee feels like they are in charge of their time. At the same
time, they can spot unproductive activities and weak points in their
performance and do something about them.

### Aim to Create a Strong Company Culture

Last but not least, your goal should be not just to have a team that’s
location independent but to build a powerful company culture. This can
happen by getting to know each other, working towards the same goals,
respecting each other’s time and valuing everyone’s skills and talents.

### Pay Close Attention to What is Happening Within the Teams

If, like most offices, you break your work up into teams, make sure
they have mastered highly effective communication within their
respective teams. For example, if your project manager is not on top of
things with the product development team, you will find that some
members of the team are working on aspects of the project that make no
sense in relation to the overall strategy or, worse, that they are
working on the same tasks in different ways. Any team lead of your
distributed teams must be a highly effective communicator, accountable
to you and your fellow executives and have a strong handle at all times
of what every member within his/her team is working on at that time.  

### Hold people accountable

As mentioned, the primary temptation with a remote work situation or for
distributed teams is that people will take advantage and slack off.
That’s why it’s crucial to lay down some goals and expectations for
each employee and ensure that those expectations are being met. Try to
toe the line though between micro-managing and merely communicating
those desires and expectations. In some cases, a remote situation can be
unworkable. If you think this is the case, before making a drastic
change, check the data (e.g. VPN logs).

### Cultivate Trust

Building strong relationships based on trust is a key challenge for
leaders of all types, but the task is especially difficult in the case
of virtual teams. In a remote workplace, trust is often closely
connected to tasks. If a team member struggles to complete their tasks
in a timely fashion, they will have difficulty earning the trust of
people who routinely hold themselves accountable for their work. A good
virtual boss must find ways to help team members develop positive views
of one another, ensuring that they will make an effort to follow through
on the responsibilities.

Keep Decisions Fast and The Team Productive Over Different Time Zones

### Use Comments and Questions

We try really hard to leave a lot of comments on everything we work on
asynchronously. For most teams, this is on JIRA, and we try to make sure
we have really clear specs with a design, a brief and maybe a mock-up,
so when developers are working on it, they will be very clear with their
status. They put in there any questions, so they get unblocked as fast
as possible by a product manager, a designer, or another teammate.

### Be Proactive

We try to move into very thorough, detailed asynchronous communication,
so people know what’s going on with the rest of the team, and they're
getting their questions answered as soon as possible. We also encourage
our team to be proactive and to make most decisions themselves. For
instance, if you get stuck on something, don't wait around for help;
just go do something else, figure out what else is valuable, or even
better, make the decision yourself\!

### Decide If Necessary

Something we really encourage is for people to make a decision and
inform the team. Say,  “I wasn’t sure about A or B; B made more sense to
me, so I went ahead and I did it. If it’s a problem, let me know and
I’ll fix it.” Nine times out of ten, the developer makes a great
decision, and everyone’s happy. Only one time out of ten do they say we
actually needed to do A, but it still saves a lot more time compared to
waiting around, being stuck.

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Address Conflicts**



<div class="panelContent">

Conflict is almost unavoidable in any collaborative project. Although
the term often has a negative connotation, conflict itself is neither
good nor bad. It simply represents a difference of opinion or a
different evaluation of available information. The way conflict is
managed, however, is what determines whether it has a positive or
negative impact on a team. Effective leaders understand that conflict
can be a valuable and productive opportunity to have a conversation
about an important issue. Managed properly, conflict can be brought to a
positive and productive resolution that actually strengthens
relationships within a team and can enhance collaborative efforts. If
conflict is ignored or handled poorly, however, it can undermine trust
among team members and make it difficult for the team to pursue its
goals effectively. Unfortunately, signs of conflict can be harder to
detect when working in virtual context.A virtual boss has to be
comfortable managing conflict rather than viewing it as something to be
avoided at all costs. Conflict can serve as a valuable growth
opportunity, both for leaders and team members. Throughout the conflict
resolution process, new ideas and solutions are often developed. Remote
managers have the ability to set the tone for managing conflict in their
teams. Rather than creating a confrontational, combative environment,
they can use conflict as an opportunity to bolster collaboration and
bring new information to light. In a remote context, where it may be
harder to recognize when there is a conflict, it’s important to deal
with conflict as directly and as quickly as possible because the nature
of remote work makes it easier for team members to avoid unpleasant
conversations, making it more likely that they’ll fester and grow until
they become unmanageable.Managing a successful remote team can be a
major challenge for leaders accustomed to a more traditional office
environment, but many of the same principles can be applied in a virtual
context. A good virtual boss must work a bit harder to cultivate good
communication and build trust, but with today’s collaborative tools,
they have extensive resources that can help them to get the most out of
their teams.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Facilitate Collaboration**



<div class="panelContent">

Remote teams allow organizations to bring together talented people to
collaborate on a specified project even if those people are separated by
distance. One of the most challenging tasks for a virtual boss is to
facilitate that collaboration. Whether they’re managing workflow or
working directly with team members to produce a specific deliverable,
there are many ways that remote leaders can help their teams work
together more effectively.

Team leaders can make it easier for team members to collaborate by
embracing any number of technology tools. Project management software
and virtual chat programs are particularly useful for leading remote
teams since they allow all members to access the same shared resources
and communicate quickly and effectively. Rather than relying upon less
structured channels like email, these solutions provide both visibility
and accountability for team members. A good virtual boss can further
enhance collaboration by holding regular check-in or brainstorming
meetings that allow everyone to update the team on what they’re working
on or seek feedback that might help them overcome a challenge.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Build Safety**



<div class="panelContent">

The last thing you want is people who feel unable to ask questions,
propose new ideas or experiment with better solutions. 

> Example:
> 
> Google has been always recognized for encouraging people to feel safe
> and free to contribute wherever they can. 
> 
>     Indeed this kind of environment has created the image of people like Jeff Dean - the Chuck Norris of Internet. Interestingly, Google was struggling to create a working advertising platform. While Google Adwards is currently the main revenue generator for Google, in the early years their platform did not work well at all! There was a major issue in the algorithms that no one could solve for months. So, during one weekend Jeff Dean fixed this problem, although he was part of a department that had nothing to do with Google Adwards. This shows that when people feel safe, have freedom and autonomy, they can contribute to solving big problems. And these problems might not be a part of their ongoing task!

In order to build safety, you can take specific steps like:

  - organize a special time (e.g sprint retrospectives) when people can
    ask questions freely
  - allow any questions and take them seriously, even from the most
    junior people
  - show people your weaknesses and fallibility – even if you are the
    leader, others must know you are a human being. This would allow
    people to show their problems early on as well
  - don't kill the messenger – thank the people that raise serious
    issues as early as possible. Don't make them feel bad that they
    spotted a problem early on, because the next time they will not let
    you know until it is too late





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Number of Social Interactions Per Week**



<div class="panelContent">

The best measure of team collaboration is how many times team members
interact. If you are not at the same office, make sure you design
special meetings for interactions. Encourage people to do it even
online.

> Example:
> 
> Tell George to call Stefan, because he has something interesting to
> share\! Or ask your remote team to go together for lunch and give them
> a topic to talk about. It is very inspiring if the topic is not about
> work, rather than something of a higher value, such as how can we stop
> poverty or why did we end up with the situation in Syria.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**The Best and Most Neglected - Shared Experiences**



<div class="panelContent">

The last one goes to live interaction and having shared fun experiences.
If you doubt the investment of getting people at the same place, I am
personally investing in inviting our partners in joining us during our
team building events. 

These shared experiences are the best way to strengthen the team spirit,
motivate people and show that you care on only what each one delivers at
work, but also you value them as people. 

Is all about the shared sense of pushing towards one goal that drives
people motivation and makes team members engaged. And [statistics
show](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/275161) that motivated people
can be as much as 500% more productive than unmotivated ones\! 

I hope you have found some actionable advice on how to get most of the
value from your distributed team. Have fun while applying them\! And
please, share yours in the comments section below.

**Do's and Don'ts of Managing a Remote Developer Team**



<div class="panelContent">

  - **DO **make sure you invest on 1:1s with your team.
  - **DO **make sure you’re really listening to your team and checking
    in on how they are doing, because you can’t just walk around the
    office and see the dynamic; you need people to tell you. This is the
    most important.
  - **DON’T **be that manager who constantly asks, hey, what’s happening
    with this feature? Hey, what happened with the status? This may be
    the most important don’t. Figure out a system where you are getting
    status updates asynchronously. There’s a ton of tools, so use them\!

Cultrual Sensitivty in Working with Other Cultures



<div id="expander-content-1478589451" class="expand-content">

Cultural differences can be a challenge in an international workplace,
but at the same time cultural diversity can also be fascinating, said
Rachel Smets. At Positive Psychology in Practice 2019 she suggested we
prepare ourselves when working with other cultures or moving abroad, and
develop our cultural sensitivity by learning about new cultures as much
as we can.

Smets stated that among the people she interviewed, including many
digital nomads like herself, the one thing they all mentioned as a key
ingredient to a successful move was "prepare well". She suggested to do
research in advance:

> Depending on your current situation, your research will be based on
> your goals, but let’s assume you’re a digital nomad and able to work
> from anywhere; you need to decide about your new destination, your
> house or other accommodation to rent or buy, the family that will join
> you or stay behind, your finances, the new language, but also, the
> required visa and paperwork. Adding to these basics, there are topics
> like pets, schools, vaccinations, insurance, health care etc...

We can learn about a new culture by doing research and reading about
their habits, foods, festivals, language, history, etc. Smets mentioned
that it doesn’t have to be complicated; just put in some effort to
inform yourself:

As a digital worker, doing business with many different cultures and
showing your knowledge about certain local culture customs will
demonstrate an interest in their culture, which can be very advantageous
in business.

Positive psychology can be applied to help people adjust to or deal with
a culture that’s new to them; it is really the answer and solution in
everything here, said Smets. The science is all about happiness,
optimism, well-being, satisfaction, flow, and so on, and in the pursuit
of "good feeling" this also relates to your interpersonal relations with
other cultures.

How are you adjusting to others? How are you communicating with others?
Maybe they use a different language, but there’s much more to
communication than that, said Smets. In the Netherlands people are very
direct, blunt and may come across as "rude" to those from another
country where language is indirect, and the message must be understood
through cues like body language, facial expressions, or eye contact.

Smets gave the example of how some Asian people say "yes", which can
have five different meanings: "yes", "maybe," "I’ll try," "no," and "I’m
not sure." She mentioned her video on <span class="underline">[deadlines
across cultures](https://youtu.be/WXXqdDzwWrg)</span>, which provides
examples and solutions to communicating across cultures.

Positive psychology can also be related to the "Golden Rule", as Smets
explained:

> We’re used to the golden rule, as in "Treat others like you would like
> to be treated," however, when it comes to cultural differences, the
> Golden Rule that is most effective is "Treat others the way THEY want
> to be treated". In essence, adjust to them, and harmony will be
> created.

"Working abroad has been a great experience in every country I’ve
lived," said Smets. She mentioned that a challenge is always paperwork,
such as all the tax systems, getting the utility contract done, work
contracts, a visa if needed, internet at home, registrations in the new
country, and the administration part is always a challenge, in some
countries it being faster than others. Patience and persistence is the
key solution here, Smets said.

Communication Patterns



<div id="expander-content-524984872" class="expand-content">

Are these models true in practice? Not always, but it’s a good place to
start, highlighting how differently teams approach communication and
negotiation.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/external_clips/attachments/55802/original/communication-patterns-cultures.gif?1430439073)

But each culture’s perception of time can even be more complicated and
conflicting than that. Take the case of how deadlines are perceived in
Germany versus how they’re perceived in Spain, again from “When Cultures

Meetings and Time Management



<div id="expander-content-739955345" class="expand-content">

Communication is vital when working with an offshore team. Ideas should
be conveyed properly and comprehensively to swiftly and efficiently
deliver the output. However, communication seems to be a lot harder than
you think when your team is countries away and a few hours ahead. Some
business owners find it hard to keep up with the time difference. Some
even stay late at night just to set a meeting for the offshore team.
Tiresome, isn’t it?

Have regular meetings.

Language and Cultural Barrier



<div id="expander-content-339668948" class="expand-content">

Different time zones, different location, and so is the practice
of [different
cultures](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254458811_Time_Zones_Matter_The_Impact_of_Distance_and_Time_Zones_on_Services_Trade).
Let’s say, for example, an American company hired an offshore team from
Asia. American culture is quite different from Asian culture. There may
be some aspect that one nationality would find the actions of the other
quite offensive and vice versa. This kind of misunderstanding, cultural
barrier, is one of the reasons that offshore outsourcing fails. The
difference of Western culture from Eastern culture is quite far-fetched
that is why some businesses are having so many second thoughts and
doubts when offshoring.

Calendar



<div id="expander-content-180974348" class="expand-content">

Offshoring from a different country also means different calendar
holidays and weekends. There are countries in which their weekends are
not aligned with your country’s weekends. Holidays also differ depending
on which country you are doing business with, which may cause a problem.
Delays, miscommunication, and poor quality are some of the consequences
of time zone difference.

Over Communicate



<div id="expander-content-733099735" class="expand-content">

Communication has been a highlight in every offshoring business so it is
fair to keep this one in mind at all times. When you communicate with
your offshore development team, it is not enough to just schedule a
fifteen-minute meeting and tell them what to do and have them carry on
whatever they are doing. We encourage our clients to constantly
communicate with their offshore team. It isn’t necessary to purely talk
about updates and the software. Take this time to know your offshore
team and share your ideas and goals so you can convey your desired
outcome of the project. This will minimize misunderstanding and delays.

Overlap Your Schedules



<div id="expander-content-16586752" class="expand-content">

One of the most effective strategies is making sure that you overlap
your schedule with your offshore team. It can be a few hours in the
morning or in the evening. This strategy ensures that your offshore team
recognizes your presence even though you aren’t with them physically.
This also ensures that you can ask for updates and work with them for a
few hours to smoothly produce the project.

With the various latest technology makes communication so much easier
for businesses. Distance and time zone difference is no longer seen as a
terrible hindrance compared to earlier years. With the use of
applications and the internet, you can simply contact your offshore team
for a video conference. Make sure that you constantly ask for updates
and ask your team if there are problems or difficulties to ensure that
communication is open.

Treat Them Like Your Own Team



<div id="expander-content-1237031437" class="expand-content">

One thing not to forget is that your offshore team is part of your team.
Though they are located halfway around the world, they work on your
project and are aiming the same goals. Your offshore team is not an
outsider, rather they are an extension of your team.  

Working across multiple time zone can be very tricky but very beneficial
once you [properly execute this
strategy](https://fullscale.io/tips-for-managing-an-offshore-development-team/).
Matt DeCoursey and Matt Watson, founders of Full Scale, have encountered
the challenges in working across time zones. Since 2009, they have
recruited developers from the Philippines to work on projects of their
respective companies and they successfully overcame that challenge. Now,
they are sharing this strategy to other startups who wish to scale up
their businesses. Full Scale makes sure that the time zone difference
does not create chaos while working on a project thus the creation of
our development process, [Guided
Development](https://fullscale.io/our-services/).

At Full Scale, your ideas are valued more than anything else. You are in
control of your project, on how it should be produced. We take the
burden of finding suitable developers off your plate. We do recruitment,
assessment, and hiring. During the production, we also have project
managers that can help manage your offshore team. Pair our development
process with the tips and guides above, your business will scale up the
just like how you want it.

Don’t let the time zones stop you from achieving your business goals. Be
wise in handling your time and your team. Choose the right offshore
development center.

Keep Their Work Queue Full, Including "B" Tasks



<div id="expander-content-426895506" class="expand-content">

There will be many times when your offshore team may get stuck and need
help from someone else. The last thing you want to do is have them get
stuck and get nothing accomplished.

There are countless reasons that developers get stuck in middle of their
work. From weird compilation issues check in by someone else, business
logic questions, lack of clear requirements, etc.

I suggest always having multiple work items in their queue so if they
get stuck, they have someone else they can work on. If they get stuck on
their “A” task, make sure they have a “B” or “C” priority item they can
work on in the meantime.

Give them Real Work To Do



<div id="expander-content-316568346" class="expand-content">

Just because you can find offshore developers for $25 an hour, that
doesn’t mean you need to only give them shit work to do. They make $25
an hour because the cost of living where they live is a fraction of
Silicon Valley, not because they are junior developers.

Just as your developers hate doing shitty projects, so do they. If you
want to recruit and retain top talent on your offshore team, don’t make
them do shit work.

I recently hired a developer in our Cebu City, Philippines office that
worked at IBM for the last 6 years in Cebu. He might be the smartest
developer I have ever hired. He is also the best value I have ever
gotten for my money.

Set your expectations high. There are highly skilled developers all over
the world. Treat them like it\!

Don't Micromanage



<div id="expander-content-258590332" class="expand-content">

Nobody likes to be micromanaged. It is also hard to scale your
development team if you can’t empower them and trust them to do the work
that needs to be done. It is important that your offshore team has a
strong senior developer that can act as a team lead.

If you are having problems getting things done properly, consider if
your offshore team lacks senior level leadership. Many companies make
the mistake of just trying to hire a bunch of cheap developers.

It is in the best interest of you and your offshore partner both to
ensure that your offshore team can be self managing and successful. Make
sure you have the right mix of senior developers and potentially a
project manager.

Standardize Communication Tools



<div id="expander-content-1754585724" class="expand-content">

This one seems obvious of course.  When you’re working with someone at
least a continent away, you better know how to get a hold of them, or
what do you have really?  Someone you’re paying for work you may not
actually be getting.

This is a huge issue in the outsourcing industry, and can be a huge
cause of concern for those people who have never worked with an offshore
team - many managers who have onshore/offshore couplings report that
prior to implementing this structure, this is the \#1 fear about
offshoring their onshore folks report.

(**Disclosure**: at [ModPH](http://modph.com/) - which I founded and run
- we use implementation coordinators and a standard set of tools to
prevent this feeling from turning into an accepted fact from day 1
- [contact us](http://modph.com/contact-us/) to find out how.)

Email, while necessary for some things, should be limited in its use.
 Email is an asynchronous communication method - asynchronous
meaning *not at the same time*.  If you work in the same physical
 office with someone and want to talk to them, just them, would you
send them an email or would you turn around and just *talk to them*.  Of
course you would do the latter.  If you use email (with or without a
time difference) you automatically cause a delay in communication. That
may be ok for some things, but generally is not in today’s working
world.

Your offshore team mate should be no different.  I recommend a group
skype chat between you and your offshore team mate that others can join
if necessary.  If you’re using slack or another messaging app
internally, make sure they’re on it.  Talk via voice frequently, or use
video when you can (it’s been reported that 90% of all communication is
non-verbal - the most common cause of things “getting lost in
translation”).





<div id="expander-1975186676" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1975186676" class="expand-control">

Manage the Workflow



<div id="expander-content-1975186676" class="expand-content">

No matter where work is done, in our modern working environment, you
have absolutely no excuse not to have some type of workflow management
solution in place. It doesn’t have to be complex, or full-featured, or
anything more than a shared to-do list.  But it must be visible to all,
must have a way to communicate priority, and it must record who is
changing what.

There are a number of different tools with these essential qualities.
 If you need something with time tracking that’s full-featured - I’m
partial to
Jetbrain’s [Youtrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/) (it’s
also very good at managing per-piece work); It can do time time
tracking, priorities, and gives you a visual view of what’s work is in
what status (via a [kanban
board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)).

For the most simplistic view, a shared google sheet is sufficient.  Just
have columns for work description, work type (helpful for grouping
things and seeing patterns among tasks, essential for growth), submit
date, due date, notes and of course status.  You may add columns as your
specific style of work requires. I used to use a tool
called [workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) which was great for me
individually, but one team member used to have trouble working with it
in shared lists, even though we worked closely together; but it’s a
dead-simple solution.

[Asana](https://asana.com/) is probably the best solution in between the
two (though I’m sure there are others).  It’s much more team focused,
and the ability to put things into projects, or share projects among a
bunch of different people is great, especially when you need your
offshore person to interact with more than just their buddy on projects.





<div id="expander-1012582254" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1012582254" class="expand-control">

Patience



<div id="expander-content-1012582254" class="expand-content">

As I’ve said before in this post, 90% of all communication is
non-verbal.  I’m not sure I believe it’s that high, but ultimately when
working with offshore what this translates into is simply less efficient
communication.  SO, if in our modern workplace we rely on communication
to get someone up to speed, then inherently that communication is going
to be slower, and thus progress of training will be slower, because the
person we’re trying to train isn’t right in front of us.  Logical.

But all is not lost.  A LOT can be done through video/voice, and even
text chat. There’s a lot that CAN’T be done through email. It’s best to
accept the fact that our workplace today is increasingly distributed,
and will continue to be so.  The salient fact is that your
communications with your offshore buddy won’t be as speedy as with
someone face to face.  So having a little patience with this
understanding will go along way toward making you successful in working
with your offshore folks.

If you’re currently working with offshore staff or thinking about it,
take these 5 things to make your daily work with them faster, better,
and smoother, I know you’ll be happy with the results\!

New Team Members



<div id="expander-content-381958883" class="expand-content">

## Selecting New Team Members

Your initial team is set up and you've met with at least the top members
of the distributed team you’ve decided to work with and the rest via
online conferencing (with video\!). Your software product/platform is
going great, it attracts more and more users and you need to fuel the
growth by adding more people to the team. Now here is the tricky part –
you need to make sure you attract the right people;  not only in terms
of expertise, but also in terms of fitting in with the existing team and
sticking to the same practices and standards.

There is an interesting experiment where one person pretends to be a
slacker and demoralizes the experiment team. It turns out that if there
is a strong formal or informal team leader, he or she can negate the bad
influence of this person. But what if you get more of these people?

One of my main jobs as CEO of a custom software development company is
to make sure we don't have any misfits within the team. That's why we
have a 2 step (for seniors even a 3 step) interview process that is
testing both soft and hard skills. We're very careful in our selection
and we're very quick to fire during the trial period . But if you are
working with remote freelancers, make sure you do a thorough interview
before bringing someone in\!

Additionally, conduct a 2<sup>nd</sup> interview which tests their team
work, interpersonal skills, as well as their fit for the culture you
want to establish in your product team\!

## How You Onboard Might Be Even More Important

An experiment run by one of the biggest IT companies worldwide showed
that with good on boarding, you can get double the employee engagement
in just one hour\! This sounds like one of the best 1-hour investments
you can ever do for your project\!

I have made the mistake of on boarding people by telling them how great
the company is and how interesting the project/team he is joining is.
 It turns out it is far better to ask the newcomer about them and let
them talk. You can ask questions about:

  - their past experience and how it fits in the project
  - what motivates them and what unique skills they have
  - what are their personal aims/hobbies/challenges outside of work

And to increase engagement – if the person is at another location (e.g.
a software partner like us), send something small, like a branded
T-shirt, a key holder or anything that the person can receive as a token
for being part of the team.

Team Member with No Previous Experience with Remote Teams



<div id="expander-content-163504353" class="expand-content">

We put a lot of effort into on boarding for anybody, even if they have
worked remotely before, and if they haven’t, we note that in the on
boarding document to give extra support. Previous remote experience is
not a requirement for people joining Buffer.

## Discuss Everything Up-Front

We'll talk to them about where they are going to work from, how they
will set up their workspace, how they are going to set up their
schedule, how they are going to stay healthy and productive at the same
time, and how they will have enough work time and also not too much work
time. We believe it’s key to talk to them very openly and very honestly
about the lovely advantages of a remote team, and the hard part of it as
well, to make sure they consider every aspect.

## Create Clear Goals

Every developer gets a 30-, 60-, and 90-day on boarding plan, which has
really clear goals.  

## Assign a Culture Buddy

They’ll also get a culture buddy, whose job is to talk to this person
once a week, advise on their challenges, and how to work better
remotely, how to communicate with their team, how to stay healthy and
how to stay productive.

Cultural Fit



<div id="expander-content-188329745" class="expand-content">

Hiring - Candidate Culture Fit



<div id="expander-content-824644043" class="expand-content">

Evaluating culture fit is dangerous when “culture” means looking for
candidates who are exactly like you and your peers. This monolithic view
develops when recruiters conflate their personal lives with their
professional lives. Instead of focusing on values, this definition of
culture causes recruiters to look for applicants who went to their alma
mater or, perhaps even worse, someone they “would share a beer with.”

Hiring for culture fit doesn't have to be bias-riddled, though. Keep the
term positive by recognizing that culture is tied to your company's core
values—not specific behaviors and experiences—and by defining your
values in a way that is intentional and inclusive. Each principle should
directly relate to a candidate’s ability to thrive at your organization
and should be broad enough to align with any skilled applicants.

Here are a few examples to make the distinction clearer:

  - **Exclusive value**: “Our team is built with individuals who have a
    strong academic record and have shown a passion for lifelong
    learning.”

  - **Inclusive value**: “Our team members share a desire to be lifelong
    learners.”

For most positions, a high GPA and graduate education aren’t required
qualifications that lead to better job performance. However
anyone—regardless of their background—can have an enthusiasm for
learning, and a drive to continually grow and learn can lead to stronger
job performance.

When your company's values are defined explicitly and inclusively,
evaluating culture fit is a valuable process, not a problematic one.
Without excluding any applicants based on their background, you're able
to find the candidates that are a strong fit for your company, and
likely to stick around.

  

<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Why does it Matter**



<div class="panelContent">

Your employees spend a substantial portion of their lives dedicated to
work and building a career. If they don’t love the work they’re doing
and the people they’re working with, that can quickly spiral into an
undesirable work environment — which will inevitably lead to employee
turnover.

As leaders and hiring managers, it’s important you take this into
consideration and understand the impact hiring new employees can have on
your existing team, their productivity, and the health and growth
potential of your company.

If you’re looking to grow, it should be done with intention and your
existing company culture in mind. Otherwise, you run the risk of making
a bad investment and hire.

Here are a few critical reasons why making culture fit a priority and
finding the “right” hire are so important to your business.

## Making a new hire is a major investment. You want to get it right the first time.

Hiring and [onboarding a new employee is
expensive](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/hidden-costs-employee-onboarding-reduce/).
How expensive? Well, that cost varies by business, but there are a few
factors that are universal.

First, let’s talk about the soft cost of time.

Once you’ve identified a hiring need, you’re probably looking to fill
that position sooner than later. Until you are able to do so, this
oftentimes means that other members of your team must own those
responsibilities until you’ve got the new person in place.

Their time and happiness are important, but so is finding the right
person to own that role. So while the need to fill an open position can
create pressure to make a quick hire, **it’s worth the wait to ensure
you’ve made the right hire**.

Otherwise, you might not actually provide the relief and support your
team needs.

**Going through a formal hiring process is time-consuming.** Team
members spend dozens of hours reviewing applications and resumes,
coordinating and conducting interviews. This time compounds as you
increase the number of people involved in the hiring process (which you
should) to ensure the team working with the new hire feels confident in
their capabilities and fit with the company.

Post-hire, the team will also invest significant time onboarding the new
team member.

Having recently completed my own onboarding at IMPACT, I can speak first
hand to this experience, and the amount of time and effort dedicated by
my team to ensure I was set up for success.

Depending on the company and amount of time that can be afforded to
getting you ramped up, onboarding can take weeks, if not months, to
ensure you’re properly trained and acclimated. It involves multiple
teams/departments, including HR, direct managers and peers, and other
company leaders who commit to educating you and providing you with
critical resources on the company culture, processes, technology, and
your core job function.

Now, let’s factor in the hard cost of the financial investment.

Beyond an employee’s compensation package, there are multitudes of other
financial commitments associated with bringing on a new person. These
could include, but are not limited to:

  - Travel for interviewing and onboarding
  - Relocation/moving expenses
  - Technology and equipment (e.g. laptop, monitor, mobile devices, key
    fob, another desk, and office supplies, etc.)
  - Swag and more

For example, at IMPACT we not only invest in an on-site, in-person
interview at the end of our hiring process to ensure it’s a good fit for
company *and* employee, but we also bring each new hire in for a full
week of on-site onboarding with the Connecticut team.

Beyond travel, each new employee is provided the technology needed for
their day-to-day work (i.e. laptop, monitor, mouse and keyboard,
headset, etc.), as well as some awesome IMPACT swag so they’re outfitted
like the rest of the team.

## A bad-fit hire creates negative energy and decreased productivity/momentum for the team

Have you ever worked with someone who just didn’t jibe with the rest of
the team? Maybe they didn’t have a team-first mentality, participate in
company activities or bring a positive, uplifting attitude to their
work?

While it shouldn’t be a requirement that every employee be an A-team
player and involved in every aspect of the company, it is important that
the team be aligned at some level to share in that collective culture
and purpose.

Even if a new employee can complete their job functions effectively, a
negative attitude, infighting, and other distractions can drag down the
rest of the team.

If the team dynamic shifts and creates a negative work environment for
other employees, you could end up affecting the happiness of other team
members, or worse...losing a valued team member entirely.

## Losing a great team member (or having a high employee turnover rate) is bad for team morale and business.

Losing a critical or valued team member is never easy. It not only
creates issues from a workflow standpoint, but it can deeply affect the
morale of your team and the confidence of your customers/clients.  

Additionally, the longevity of your employee base shows stability and
can serve as a strong indicator to future applicants that you offer a
career destination versus a job, which is something many employees are
looking for when considering an employer. People want to be reassured
that they can grow and evolve within your organization.

It’s also not cheap to lose a team member. On average, [it costs 150% of
a mid-level person’s salary to replace
them](https://www.tlnt.com/what-was-leadership-thinking-the-shockingly-high-cost-of-employee-turnover/).
So when that $80,000 person isn’t a good hire, it costs the company an
about $120,000 to bring in someone else (fingers crossed *they’re* a
good hire\!). This is certainly not great for the bottom line.

So why is it so important that you hire for a culture fit? Because
making the right hire makes all the difference. Acquiring a great
employee brings countless benefits, including:

  - Technical skill and increased team capabilities and expertise,
  - value beyond their core job function,
  - a positive work environment/team dynamic,
  - encouragement and inspiration of excellence, and so on.

**Ways to find candidates who match your culture**



<div class="panelContent">

## Honestly craft your employer brand

You'll naturally attract candidates who are aligned with your culture if
your employer brand authentically reflects your values.

If you don't breathe internally what you brand externally, you will run
into trouble. Your messaging will attract candidates who aren't a great
fit and aren't likely to stay at your company.

For example, say your company promotes its workplace as one with a
passion for lifelong learning. With this messaging, your company should
offer employees plenty of educational opportunities, like tuition
assistance, training programs, or opportunities to attend conferences.
New hires with a passion for learning may have joined expecting these
kinds of offerings, so if your company doesn’t walk the walk in terms of
learning opportunities, new employees may end up unhappy and even decide
to leave.

Honestly crafting an employer brand is easier said than done. Work your
way through the process by following these strategies:

  - **Don't worry about competitors' branding.** The candidate who is a
    great match for your competitor may be a terrible match for your
    company, so don't try to emulate competitor messaging.

  - **Focus on the values that make your company unique.** Highlighting
    your one-of-a-kind philosophies will help your company stand out to
    applicants who align with your culture.

## Ask the right questions

The mistake that many companies make with culture fit is informally
gauging whether a candidate is a good match for their workplace. A
decision about the applicant might be made based on a casual lunch
conversation or in an unstructured interview.

Be intentional about the questions you're asking a candidate when
assessing culture fit. I recommend behavior-based questions that are
tied to your values.

For example, say you're a tech company, and one of your core values is
“respect the user.” In that case, a great interview question about
behavior would be, “Tell me about a time when you were involved in a
decision that didn't respect the user.” The applicant will tell you what
they did to correct the situation, and you can assess how user-focused
they are, based on their actions.

Get the most out of behavioral, value-based questions by following these
interviewing tips:

  - **Be prepared to probe and dig deeper.** The conversation doesn't
    stop at the applicant's first answer. Get to the root of the initial
    question by asking follow-up questions to fully understand the
    applicant's answer.

  - **Plan questions beforehand with hiring managers.** This planning
    will help the interview process flow smoothly, and it's an
    opportunity to catch any questions that are biased. You may also
    consider implementing an [interviewing
    rubric](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/hiring-use-structured-interviewing/steps/use-a-grading-rubric/) in
    order to ensure that everyone is aligned on how to objectively
    assess for each value.

## Get everyone involved in recruiting

When all employees are involved in recruiting, it's much easier to
communicate your culture to candidates.

Applicants build a strong sense of your company values when they're able
to meet with all types of employees at your company, not just
recruiters. By talking to a potential coworker, candidates can gain more
insight into whether they are a good fit for the company's culture.

For example, I once set up an informal lunch meeting between a candidate
and an engineering leader that had a major impact on the applicant's
offer decision. The engineering leader really espoused the values of the
company that I had communicated to the candidate, so I thought it would
be useful for the candidate to speak with him. The lunch sealed the deal
for the applicant.

If your company doesn't have a [culture of
recruiting](https://hire.google.com/articles/create-a-culture-of-recruiting/),
use these tactics to encourage participation in the hiring process:

  - **Set up cross-functional interviews** or meetings with an employee
    from a different department. The process gives candidates a deeper
    sense of the culture by talking to someone who isn't trying to
    promote their department.

  - **Encourage executive involvement.** If employees see that
    executives are involved in recruiting, they will feel motivated to
    pitch in as well. Ask senior leadership to speak at career events
    and communicate with candidates publicly.

Employees who align with your core values are more likely to contribute
to your company for years. Find those applicants by evaluating culture
fit. Once you recognize that culture fit is really a reflection of your
core values that anyone can embrace, it becomes an inclusive, valuable
framework.

Here are some elements and standards to consider that can inspire and
best communicate your company culture to candidates:

  - **Mission**. Invest in employees who believe in the greater purpose
    of your organization. They believe that individual contributions
    enable us to realize that mission each and every day.
  - **Vision**. Look for team members who are committed to helping you
    reach and exceed organizational and team goals. Their drive and
    ideas are critical to growth and innovation.
  - **Purpose and Passion**. Identify candidates who will show up
    excited and be present — their energy and positivity are infectious.
    Fostering intangible passion and purpose, along with the right
    opportunities and guidance, will inspire your entire organization.
  - **Value.** Find employees who look to create enormous value — for
    the organization and those you serve.

While you can discuss these as an executive or leadership team, it may
also be a good exercise to take several questions back to the broader
team and get their perspective. You may be surprised to see that the
company culture has taken on a personality and perspective of its own.

Consider posing the following questions to your current team:

  - What is the tone of our company voice?
  - What do we value as an organization?
  - What qualities do the best employees embody that help make our
    company an incredible place to work?
  - Describe a time when you felt excited or inspired working with a
    teammate? What about that experience helped foster those feelings?
  - Where do we want to be five years from now, and who do we need/want
    on the team that will enable us to get there?

Once you’ve collected thoughtful responses from your team, use their
answers to help define the ideal team member and evolve your interview
questions accordingly.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Culture Isn't Always Organic**



<div class="panelContent">

It's easier than you think; you just need to put your mind to it.
Everything you really want from a great culture is wrapped up in a
pretty simple formula: vision + values + plans and targets.

**Vision:** Where are your company's goals? Why are you in this
particular business, and what do you ultimately hope to accomplish?

**Values**: More than pretty words on the wall, values need to reflect
what really makes your company different. What is the DNA of someone who
would work well there? Core values aren't mere platitudes, such as
"People are our most important asset." They reflect a point of view,
such as "Competition drives improvement."

**Plans and targets:** As a leader, you need to know not only where your
business is going but how to get there. If you communicate your
objectives clearly, your team members will know the score and how to
contribute.

Each of the above elements is supported
by **clarity **and **consistency**, meaning the company does what it
says and says what it does. In my experience, the companies that
frustrate people the most provide mixed messages. When someone realizes
he signed up for the wrong team, he'll likely leave on his own. When a
company tells someone one thing and acts another way, that person will
get frustrated and angry.

Why Culture is Important



<div id="expander-content-1592967102" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

Organizations can actively create strong cultural environments that
represent their values and make their company a great place for
employees and customers by focusing on these attributes.

Out of all the employees and business leaders whom I have interviewed
over the years, the vast majority of them have always told me that
culture is what they care about most. Unlike
the [physical](https://www.inc.com/jacob-morgan/how-physical-environment-impacts-employee-experience.md?cid=search) and [technological](https://www.inc.com/jacob-morgan/forget-enterprise-grade-technology-consumer-grade-technology-is-future.md?cid=search) environments, [cultural](https://www.inc.com/jacob-morgan/want-to-change-your-culture-start-by-redefining-manager.md?cid=search) environment
isn't something that you can see, taste, touch, or breath in. This is
the only environment that you feel. That feeling is the pit in your
stomach when you don't want to go to work or the excitement and
butterflies you get from wanting to go to work. Simply put, the cultural
environment is the vibe of your organization and the actions that are
taken to create that vibe or feeling.

![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/inlineimage/630x0/CELEBRATED%20\(widescreen\)_50291.jpg)

The culture of the organization determines how employees are treated,
the products or services that are created, the partnerships that are
established, and even how employees actually get their jobs done. What's
fascinating about culture, though, is that it exists regardless of
whether the organization realizes it or decides to create it. A
technological environment doesn't exist without actual things that the
organization deploys. A physical environment doesn't exist unless the
organization creates or designates one. But the corporate culture is
like air--it's around all the employees who work there even if they
aren't always aware of it. That is what it's so crucial to actually
create and design a culture instead of just letting it exist.
              

So what does the cultural environment actually look like? There are 10
attributes that organization must focus on to create a CELEBRATED
culture:

•    **Company is viewed positively**. Just like when you bring home a
significant other to meet the family for the first time and want to get
their approval, employees want to feel good about the company they work
for. Employees should be proud to work for an organization because it
has a good reputation in the industry and in the community.

•    **Everyone feels valued**. Employees want to feel valued at work,
which covers a lot of categories. It means that their work is
appreciated, their presence is noticed, their ideas are listened to, and
they are compensated appropriately for the work they put in.

•    **Legitimate sense of purpose**. When employees have a real sense
of purpose, they feel connected to the organization and are more likely
to put in their best work because they want to, not just because they
need to. Employees and employers need to work together to develop a
sense of purpose that motivates everyone to do their best.

•    **Employees feel like they're part of a team**. Work is a team
sport, and the best organizations allow their employees to be on a
number of different teams. It could be geographically or within a
department or a group of people tasked with solving a certain problem.
Teams are dynamic and fluid and much more than can just be put on an
organizational chart.

•    **Believes in diversity and inclusion**. Diverse organizations
bring together people from all kinds of backgrounds, religions, races,
sexual orientations, and generations and mixes them to work well
together. In an inclusive environment, employees are free to be
themselves and share their unique points of view.

•    **Referrals come from employees**. When we find something good, no
matter if it's a restaurant or a movie, we naturally want to share it
with others. The same should be true of the workplace--if it's a good
place to work, employees should naturally want to share it with others
and refer their classmates, friends, and family to work there as well.

•    **Ability to learn new things and given resources to do so and
advance**. One of the worst feelings for an employee is that they are
stuck in their job with nothing new to learn and nowhere to go.
Development programs, training, and new technology can encourage
employees to learn something new and keep them engaged and moving
forward.

•    **Treats employees fairly**. Sticky situations may arise at work,
but the best organizations treat their employees fairly. That means
there aren't biases towards certain ideas or types of people and that
putting in real effort gets noticed by people who matter.

•    **Executives and managers are coaches and mentors**. The days of
leaders sitting at the top of the organization and looking down on
employees are long gone. Today, executives and managers are on the
ground, interacting with employees to encourage them and coach them
through their jobs and careers.

•    **Dedicated to employee health and wellness**. Employees can't
focus at work if they aren't taking care of their physical and mental
health. Forward-thinking organizations realize that wellness is
connected to job performance and provide ways for employees to improve
their health at work and at home.

By focusing on these elements, organizations can actively create strong
cultural environments that represent their values and make their company
a great place for employees and customers.

Nice versus Competent two-by-two matrix.

It's obvious that businesses want as many [nice/competent
employees](https://www.inc.com/robert-glazer/heres-why-theres-no-such-thing-as-good-company-culture.md) as
possible, and to move on from any unpleasant, incompetent employees.
What's more challenging, he noted, are the people who exist in the other
two quadrants--people who are talented but difficult, which he referred
to as "brilliant jerks," and people who are nice but don't perform well,
which he termed "friendly incompetents."

![](attachments/458555498/458559752.jpg)

Many organizations tolerate the brilliant jerk even though that person
is very dangerous to company culture. However, he said people in the
friendly incompetent quadrant are the ones who can present the biggest
barrier to success.

I eventually realized company culture depends upon how a leadership team
handles those two types of employees--<span class="underline">friend
incompetents</span> and <span class="underline">brilliant jerks</span>.
It's more difficult than you'd think, as those people eventually hurt
your business and/or your morale. Here's why.

<div id="expander-590266303" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-590266303" class="expand-control">

A brilliant jerk's high performance isn't always worth it



<div id="expander-content-590266303" class="expand-content">

It's tempting to ignore brilliant jerks' bad behavior because they get
great results. These are the people who do the right things for the
wrong reasons. Plenty of world-changing companies were built by people
who were gifted but difficult to work with, or even disrespectful to
their colleagues.

But leaders who lean on the talent of a brilliant jerk, or even reward
them with advancement, run the risk of poisoning their culture and
alienating other key employees. Most people have no interest in working
with people who are rude or discourteous to them, and you will likely
lose other top performers who are sick of dealing with your brilliant
jerks. They can drive away valuable employees and negatively impact your
entire company culture.





<div id="expander-848450421" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-848450421" class="expand-control">

Friendly incompetents may be great people, but they don't guarantee good
results.



<div id="expander-content-848450421" class="expand-content">

To be clear, the term incompetent is not a general
characterization--friendly incompetent is meant to convey that the
person isn't performing well in their current role. These are people who
have a positive attitude and exude your core values. This is why you
give them second and third chances to perform, even if they keep making
the same mistakes and missing the mark.

It's often difficult for managers to give tough and honest feedback to a
person they really like. Instead, they allow the poor performance to
continue because they overlook the poor performance or they keep hoping
they will turn the corner. However, this inaction sends a clear message
to others: if you are likable, then results don't matter. That is not
the hallmark of a high performing culture.

We've had this happen at our company, including with an employee we'll
call "Jim." Jim was a beloved colleague who wasn't growing along with
the business. Rather than ignoring the problem, we had a candid
conversation about his performance. It turned out Jim's job had turned
into something he didn't enjoy anymore, [therefore he was not engaged
and wanted to do something
else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV2Qfj0ft0o).

People who are nice, but underperforming, don't always need to leave the
company. In some cases, they need coaching and may just be in the wrong
role. But it's important for leaders to acknowledge that people they
like still need to meet high standards--and to hold them to those
standards. Otherwise, top-performing employees will notice the double
standards and may move on.

You are what you tolerate



<div id="expander-content-1691534785" class="expand-content">

![](attachments/458555498/458559752.jpg)

It can be easy to overlook things like a few missed metrics or
complaints about a difficult employee. But these might be smaller signs
of a bigger problem--your company values are ultimately defined by your
tolerance of performance and behavior.

The best companies have cultures that are both healthy and
high-performing. If you tolerate, or even reward, brilliant jerks
because they perform well, you introduce toxicity into your culture.
People will believe it's a fend for yourself mentality and will
eventually either adopt the behavior that is rewarded or chose to leave.

Conversely, it's important for employees to know that even the most
beloved employees are still expected to meet the company standards. If
you tolerate poor performance, that inevitably pushes the burden onto
your top performers to pick up the slack. Top performers don't want to
work somewhere where people aren't expected to pull their weight.

Ultimately, the way you handle these two employees says everything about
your culture and company values.

**Change starts wtih management**



<div class="panelContent">

Organizations that consider managers as leaders tend to be more
forward-thinking and have replaced the outdated idea that managers sit
on pedestals to boss around employees.

What do you think of when you hear the word
“[manager](https://www.inc.com/claire-lew/screw-golden-rule-managers-do-not-treat-employees-way-youd-like-to-be-treated-heres-why.md?cid=search)”?
If you’re like many employees, the words that pop into your head could
include zookeeper, cog-driver, or dictator or characteristics like
outdated or out of touch. The typical definition of the word “manager”
is simply a person who manages others. In many cases in the media and in
real life, managers are portrayed as being aloof, arrogant, or simply
incompetent and just there to do less work than
their [employees](https://www.inc.com/stacey-ferreira/why-having-employees-with-flexible-hours-will-help-you-make-it-through-holidays.md?cid=search) but
make
more [money](https://www.inc.com/amanda-abella/3-proven-ways-to-make-money-from-a-business-conference.md?cid=search).
It’s no surprise that many companies are turning away from the term
manager because it can be viewed so negatively and seen as old
fashioned.

On the other hand, what do you think of when you hear the word “leader”?
For most people, it invokes thoughts of being inspired, led somewhere
new, and gathered as a team. A leader is someone you can turn to who can
transform your work into something more meaningful and help you reach a
far-off goal. For many people, a leader isn’t an assigned or promoted
position, but rather a characteristic that someone naturally possesses.

Over time, our language has shifted so that managers and leaders have
taken on completely different definitions. One is generally considered
negatively and viewed as outdated, while the other is positive and
forward-thinking. The simple rift between two similar words may not seem
important in the long run, but it has actually created two dichotomies
inside organizations that have a large effect on how things are run.
Even without realizing it, employees may have hard feelings towards a
manager or not like their methods because of their title, while managers
may subconsciously fill their roles with a commanding presence instead
of leading a team of employees to greater success. If someone has
naturally leadership abilities, they may be viewed more positively by
employees than a manager, even though their responsibilities might be
different.

But what would happen if we focused on redefining the term manager and
equated the position with leader so that the words were interchangeable?
That simple change could have huge impacts within organizations, both
for employees and managers. Instead of feeling simply like cogs in the
machine, employees could feel empowered and like there was someone they
could go to for help, inspiration, and connectivity. Managers would feel
empowered and have the tools to inspire workers instead of simply
passing on information from executives and driving simple tasks. Instead
of feeling locked into the corporate rules, leader managers can have
more creativity to get the job done and help their employees reach new
heights.

Organizations that consider managers as leaders tend to be more
forward-thinking and have replaced the outdated idea that managers sit
on pedestals to boss around employees. This is especially important in
the future of work where most employees don’t simply work their way up
the corporate ladder anymore. By changing how organizations think about
leadership and management, organizations can make sure they are hiring
people who inspire and lead others no matter their position in the
company. Changing the definition of the word manager also changes how
companies reward and promote employees, which could resonate especially
well with a new generation of workers. Over time, we would likely see
the negative connotation for the word manager decrease and empowerment
and interaction between managers and employees increase as those
imaginary walls come down.

It may seem like a simple change, but redefining the term manager can
have a huge impact on a company and lead to a changed mindset for
everyone within its walls.

**Frequently Assessed Job Attitudes**



<div class="panelContent">

Job satisfaction and work engagement are the attitudes most familiar
professionals, and the most frequently assessed through academic and
applied research. These job attitudes have been linked to enhanced
employee and business performance and retention.

Job satisfaction is emotion-based and may change from day to day. It
reflects an employee's positive or negative evaluation of the job and
its characteristics.

Work engagement is a motivational concept, describing employees who feel
energized, enthusiastic and invigorated about their jobs. Engaged
employees will devote their personal resources—emotional, cognitive and
physical—to carrying out work tasks.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**A Less Familiar Job Attitude**



<div class="panelContent">

Perceived organizational support has been extensively studied in
academia but is mostly unknown. This job attitude reflects employees'
beliefs about the extent to which their organization cares about and
values them. Creating a supportive organization is a necessary
foundation for, and motivator of, a satisfied and engaged workforce.

Supportive organizations have high-quality practices that meet their
employees' needs (especially as to growth and development), supervisors
who value their employees and treat them with respect, and fair policies
and procedures. Employees in supportive organizations feel valued for
their contributions and identify with organizational goals and believe
that they will be rewarded for their performance.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Aligning Policies and Practices to Attitudes**



<div class="panelContent">

Leaders are in a unique position to affect job attitudes. By carefully
considering the employee outcomes or behaviors that such policies and
practices are intended to influence, with an in-depth understanding of
the differences among job attitudes can better take advantage of them.

To enhance employee and business performance, for example, an
intervention might focus on increasing work engagement. To improve
employee retention, on the other hand, an initiative might instead focus
on increasing organizational support and job satisfaction.

Numerous resources describe strategies for creating an engaged and
satisfied workforce, but few resources provide practitioner-oriented
guidance for building perceived organizational support. Accordingly,
here are several research-based tips to help HR professionals create a
supportive workplace:

  - **Create a positive work environment.****Increase the presence of
    enriching job characteristics, which signal to employees that the
    organization cares about their well-being. These include meaningful
    work tasks, the opportunity to work autonomously and occasions to
    participate in organizational decision-making.
  - **Help employees grow and develop.****Provide learning and growth
    opportunities relevant to employees' jobs, and ensure that they can
    put their newly developed knowledge and skills to use. This
    communicates to employees that the organization values their
    contributions.
  - **Align benefits with employees' needs.** Offer employees flexible
    benefits that they really need (e.g., telecommuting, supportive
    family policies), and that they view as being given voluntarily.
    Such offerings demonstrate the organization's concern for employees
    and will be appreciated. Required or commonly available benefits
    (e.g., health insurance, retirement plans) contribute little to the
    perception of organizational support.
  - **Money isn't everything***. *Surprisingly, pay levels do not relate
    to perceived organizational support, job satisfaction or other job
    attitudes. Organizations cannot simply spend their way to a happy,
    supported and engaged workforce. Go off the beaten path to compete
    for talent.

Physical Environment Impacts Employee Experience



<div id="expander-content-2134523123" class="expand-content">

The right physical workspace can help us feel more creative, engaged,
and connected to the company we work for.

There are three key environments that make up the employee experience:
technology, culture, and the physical space. I explore all three in [my
latest
book](https://www.amazon.com/Employee-Experience-Advantage-Employees-Workspaces/dp/111932162X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8),
but let's talk about the physical space, or the place where employees
actually work. This is our surroundings and includes everything from the
art that hangs on the wall to the catered meals the organization may
offer to
the [cubicles](https://www.inc.com/jacob-morgan/the-cubicle-was-actually-ahead-of-its-time.md?cid=search) or
open floor
plan [employees](https://www.inc.com/jacob-morgan/what-employees-care-about-most-at-work.md?cid=search) may
sit in. It comprises 30% of the employee experience. It's no secret why
our physical space matters: we all want to spend our workdays in
environments that energize and inspire us. These types of workspaces
help us feel more creative, engaged, and connected to the company we
work for. Not only that, but the physical environments also act as
symbols that represent the organization and our decision to be there.
Great physical environments act as positive symbols and representations;
poor physical spaces act as negative ones. This was first discovered by
Edgar Schein, a former professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management
and author of the book *Organizational Culture and Leadership*. In this
book he talks about the three levels of organizational culture, which
are artifacts, values, and assumptions. According to Schein, all three
of these things must align. There are a lot of parallels between these
three levels and the three areas of [employee
experience](https://www.inc.com/jacob-morgan/why-transparency-matters-to-employee-experience.md?cid=search).

Interestingly enough, with the rise of co-working locations, global
connectivity, and collaboration technologies, many people believe that
offices are going to die. This is only somewhat true. The traditional
idea of an office is indeed on its way out--the one with gray walls,
brown carpets, and lines of cubicles. However, the buildings themselves
are going through a bit of an office design renaissance, and instead of
disappearing, offices are reemerging as employee experience centers.
According to commercial real estate firm CBRE, commercial real estate in
the U.S. is at a seven-year high, and organizations such as Amazon,
Cisco, Samsung, Whirlpool, GE, Schneider Electric, Deloitte, Microsoft,
LinkedIn, and many others are investing millions of dollars into
creating these employee experience centers, for a very good reason. As
the world of work continues to evolve and change, so do the environments
in which the world actually gets done.

It's like redesigning a car by upgrading the engine and leaving the
interior the same--it might be more powerful, but if it's not pleasant
to spend time in, you won't want to drive it\! A recent study by
furniture manufacturer Steelcase found that nearly 90% of workers around
the world are less than satisfied with their work environments, which
means there is a lot of room for improvement.

A study from 2010 in *British Journal of Management* found that there is
a social identity that employees have with their workspaces, and the
physical environment can affect the psychological comfort of the
employees who work there.

To create a great physical environment for employees, organizations need
to focus on the following major characteristics, which are abbreviated
as COOL:

• Chooses to bring in friends and visitors

• Offers flexibility

• Organizations' values are reflected

• Leverages multiple workspace options

By focusing on these areas, which we'll look at more in-depth in future
articles, organizations can create a physical environment that
represents employees and encourages them to get involved and do their
best work.

Cost of onboarding



<div id="expander-content-1012210496" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

  

We all know that it costs money to hire. Recruiters have to advertise on
job sites, conduct interviews, run background checks and, of course,
dispense and retrieve all of the paperwork associated with adding an
employee.

But did you know that, according to Bersin by Deloitte, the average cost
per hire is almost $4,000?

That number will vary, depending on job level and on hiring practices,
but every hiring manager can relate to the problem of inflated talent
acquisition costs. Why does bringing on a new employee — which is
supposed to be a business solution — drain so many resources? Why do
accountants and financial executives pale at the notion of launching a
candidate search?

If you look a little deeper, you may find that the issue has more to do
with [onboarding](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/onboarding-checklist-culture/) a
new employee after the hiring decision than it does with recruiting.
Many HR professionals have a blind spot for this part of the process.

**How to Calculate the Cost of Onboarding a New Employee**



<div class="panelContent">

<div id="expander-1728156679" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1728156679" class="expand-control">

Onboarding Paperwork and Administrative Time



<div id="expander-content-1728156679" class="expand-content">

Onboarding requires a lot of paperwork — benefits enrollment, tax forms,
employee handbooks, NDAs, arbitration agreements and so on. But you
probably don’t spend enough on paper and ink to make a significant dent
in your budget. The real cost sink comes from the time it takes to
manage the completion of that paperwork and other administrative aspects
of onboarding. Let’s say a recruiter makes $25 an hour, and you hire
50 new employees per year, and it takes 10 hours of administrative time
to process their documents. That adds up to $12,500 per year — probably
a conservative estimate for larger companies.

There are a few ways you can minimize this time. First, digitize your
onboarding paperwork. There are plenty of HR software solutions on the
market that can bring all of the hiring process’s administrative tasks
into one system, with self-service access for employees. Second, you can
ask your new hires to complete all of their paperwork before day one on
the job. That way, they won’t waste paid time filling out forms; they’ll
spend it learning the job. According to Aberdeen, “best-in-class”
companies are [53 percent more
likely](http://v1.aberdeen.com/launch/report/research_report/12220-RR-Employee-Engagement-Workplace.asp) to
begin the onboarding process before day one.

<div id="expander-control-922891870" class="expand-control">

Early Turnover of New Hires



<div id="expander-content-922891870" class="expand-content">

If you invest weeks of time and effort into onboarding only to see an
employee quit six months later, you’ve essentially wasted all of those
resources. If this happens multiple times per year, the financial impact
can be devastating.

Research shows that being more intentional and structured during the
onboarding process can help stave off early turnover. A case study by
Corning Glass Works, for example, found that employees who attended a
structured orientation program were 69 percent more likely to stay with
the company for three years. That’s probably because good onboarding
sets clear expectations for employees and equips them for success, which
means they’re less likely to encounter surprises.





<div id="expander-374828388" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-374828388" class="expand-control">

Deferred Productivity For New Employee



<div id="expander-content-374828388" class="expand-content">

Another hidden cost of onboarding comes from the reduced productivity
that is typical of ramp-up periods, the time during which a new hire is
still learning their role and getting acclimated to the work environment
— i.e. “learning the ropes.”

New employees get less work done because they’re still figuring out how
to execute their responsibilities, navigate new communication workflows
and establish relationships. For example, they might have to do research
on an account and get up to speed before they start working with
decision-makers on that account. Some sources suggest it can take as
long as eight months for an employee to become fully productive.

The answer here is to expand your onboarding process further into the
“probationary” period. Don’t just cover the paperwork and
administrative portion; make a plan for each employee to receive the
training and mentoring they need to succeed. Sit down with them on a
regular basis and see how things are going. Do they have the resources
they need? Have they encountered any problems with processes or
co-workers?





<div id="expander-636871228" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-636871228" class="expand-control">

Provisioning During Onboarding



<div id="expander-content-636871228" class="expand-content">

Every new employee will need to get set up with a certain array of
“stuff.” That stuff could include anything from a laptop and headset
to software credentials, key fobs, ergonomic chairs, monitors, parking
permits and branded clothing. All of this stuff costs money.

Most of it you won’t be able to eliminate, especially if it’s required
for the employee to function. But there are ways to be responsible with
provisioning that can reduce costs in the long run. For starters, keep
track of everything you give out to new employees, and try to
standardize the process as much as possible. An inventory system for
hardware and equipment isn’t a bad idea. This is especially important
for large enterprises that might hire 100+ people every year.

On the IT side, you should also consider the impact of technology on
your ability to scale. If your company is still working from a
collection of desktop-based systems, you’ll need to purchase a new
license and run multiple installs every time you add a team member, not
to mention the expense of doing this for remote workers (vs. the ease of
adding users to a web-based platform).

Even as you try to cut costs associated with hiring new employees,
remember that one of the most expensive recruiting mistakes is a
slipshod hiring process that yields uncommitted workers. When those
employees quit in nine months, you’ll pay the ultimate price. Be smart
and efficient where you can, but don’t cut out crucial steps just to
save a few bucks.

**Delegation**



<div class="panelContent">

Delegation



<div id="expander-content-1871412291" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

Once a leader has begun to shift his or her mindset, it’s time to start
shifting behaviors. In my own work as a leadership coach, I have
identified eight practices of leaders who delegate successfully:

1.  They pick the right person — and it isn’t always about who *can* do
    it. Who needs to develop these skills? Who has capacity? Who has
    shown interest? Who is ready for a challenge? Who would see this as
    a reward? Successful delegators also explain why they chose the
    person to take on the task.
2.  They’re clear about what the person is responsible for and how much
    autonomy they have. In *[Drive: The Surprising Science About What
    Motivates
    Us,](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates-ebook/dp/B004P1JDJO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1466286252&sr=1-1&keywords=driven+daniel+pink)* Daniel
    Pink writes that people often want autonomy over task, team,
    technique, and time. Successful delegators let their team members
    know exactly where they have autonomy and where they don’t (yet).
3.  They describe the desired results in detail. This includes setting
    clear expectations about the outcome (“what it is”), how the task
    fits into the bigger picture (“why we’re doing it”), and criteria
    for measuring success (“what it should look like when done well”).
4.  They make sure that team members have the resources they need to do
    the job, whether it’s training, money, supplies, time, a private
    space, adjusted priorities, or help from others.
5.  They establish checkpoints, milestones, and junctures for feedback
    so that they neither micromanage nor under-lead.
6.  They encourage new, creative ways for team members to accomplish
    goals. It’s important for delegators to set aside their attachment
    to how things have been done in the past, so that they can invite,
    recognize, and reward novel approaches that work.
7.  They create a motivating environment. Successful delegators know
    when to cheerlead, coach, step in, step back, adjust expectations,
    make themselves available, and celebrate successes.
8.  They tolerate risks and mistakes, and use them as learning
    opportunities, rather than as proof that they shouldn’t have
    delegated in the first place.

Delegating well helps leaders maximize their resources, ensuring that
they’re focusing on their highest priorities, developing their team
members, and creating a culture where delegation isn’t just expected —
it’s embedded in the culture.

Successful business leaders and managers don't take on more work than
everyone else; instead, they build teams that they are comfortable
delegating work to and entrusting it will get done, according to a
recent [infographic](https://www.headwaycapital.com/blog/get-better-delegating/) from
Headway Capital.  

The research backs up this claim: CEOs skilled in delegating generate
33% greater revenue than those with low or limited delegating skills,
and also created more jobs, a [Gallup
poll](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/182414/delegating-huge-management-challenge-entrepreneurs.aspx) found.
However, more than 85% of managers said they should delegate more, but
are held back by feelings of guilt, habits, or a lack of trust, [other
research](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Gift_of_Time.md?id=JLnlBQAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description) said.

<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**“Good Job” Goes a Long Way**



<div class="panelContent">

Busy days turn into busy weeks, which turn into busy months and
years—which means we often forget to stop and celebrate small
successes. But taking a moment to recognize your team members for a job
well done in their day-to-day work is the easiest, cheapest, and most
effective way to boost morale.

That said, it’s important to recognize people the right way—you
shouldn’t just hand out meaningless compliments. Take notice when
someone has improved or gone above and beyond, and tell her that you
were genuinely impressed with the particularly good work she did.

Also make sure to find opportunities to highlight the individual
contributions of your team members in front of others. Giving
recognition in front of higher-ups, clients, or at staff meetings can go
a long way to making team members feel valued.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Set (Fun) Team Goals**



<div class="panelContent">

Setting team goals is the backbone of every good management strategy.
But while project goals, yearly performance metrics, and department-wide
deliverables are all great motivators, they can also be hard to relate
to on a daily basis.

So, work with your team to determine some immediate goals. They can be
work-related, or they can even be goofy things like reaching a team
bagel consumption goal or competing to find the weirdest daily news
story. Giving the team something to work toward in the short-term (and
rewarding them with prizes) is a great way build excitement.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Confront Frustrations Head On**



<div class="panelContent">

Even with well-deserved compliments and concrete goals to work toward,
it’s completely normal for your team members to experience moments of
low team morale. But instead of waiting for these periods to naturally
pass, use moments of frustration to seek feedback and look for
solutions. Proactively find out from your team members why they’re
feeling down and what you could do to better manage them. These
conversations can be awkward at first, but they’re also a great way to
get honest and helpful feedback.

To break the ice, try sharing a personal story about a time you were
feeling frustrated with your workload or with a past manager. Also
emphasize to each employee that you’re seeking her help in boosting team
morale, and encourage her to make suggestions on how to improve the team
dynamic.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Don’t Disrupt Schedules**



<div class="panelContent">

Office morale often suffers if team members are feeling like they can’t
meet their personal, social, or family obligations outside of work. As a
manager, you should set up your team for professional success—but also
help team members achieve goals in their personal lives.

An easy way to do this is to talk regularly with your team about their
preferred weekly schedules. Find out which employees have standing
appointments—book club on Wednesday evenings, yoga at 6pm on Tuesdays,
breakfast with a mentor on Mondays — and make it priority to accommodate
those schedules. No, you won’t be able to work around everyone all the
time, but if you’re helping your team members maintain a happy life
outside of work, they’ll bring a better attitude to the office.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Learn From Each Other**



<div class="panelContent">

When managing a group of people, it’s crucial to remind your team that
it’s made up of individuals who bring diverse skills to the group. This,
of course, applies to workplace skills—Excel, PowerPoint, [public
speaking](https://www.themuse.com/advice/your-stepbystep-guide-to-become-a-better-public-speaker-fast/)—but
don’t forget about the perhaps underutilized creative talents of your
employees.

Every few weeks, try hosting a rotating “skillshare” (you can base it on
the [Skillshare](http://www.skillshare.com/about) model of learning
anything from anyone) where a team member presents an untapped skill to
the entire group. You never know—you might have a secret wine
connoisseur, art history buff, or mini golf champ among you\!
Encouraging people to share their talents and interests will not only
give them a chance to work on something they’re really excited about,
it’ll also help the group to unwind together.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Go For Random Acts of Kindness**



<div class="panelContent">

When new hires join the team, ask them to fill out a short questionnaire
about their “favorites” (favorite candy, favorite flower, favorite
magazine, favorite sports team). Keep this information on file, and use
it when people could use an extra pick-me-up.

When someone’s been working late all week, surprise him with his
favorite candy on Friday. Or, on someone’s birthday, get her a bouquet
of her favorite flowers. Everyone appreciates random acts of kindness,
but these gestures are more meaningful if you’ve put time into
investigating and remembering gifts that they’ll actually enjoy.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Lead By Example**



<div class="panelContent">

It’s impossible to be cheery 100% of the time, but [stress and
negativity](https://www.themuse.com/advice/4-ways-to-stay-sane-in-a-toxic-office/) are
incredibly infectious. If your team is headed into a busy season or
tough project, it’s important to come to work with a good attitude every
day and to be diligent about minimizing your complaints in front of team
members.

Remember, others will look to you to understand how to approach what’s
going on in the organization and visualize the big picture perspective,
and your outlook can set the tone for your entire team’s attitude.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Go for Regular Feedback Sessions**



<div class="panelContent">

For a positive improvement in the working environment, it is always
important to have a certain degree of openness with your employees.
Considering the feedback of your employees helps you tackle and solve
the multiple problems of your company. In order to boost the morale of
your remote team members, it is important to brainstorm different ways
of holding regular feedback sessions with your [remote
employee](https://www.virtualemployee.com/?source=post_page---------------------------).





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Go for Visual Communication and Interaction**



<div class="panelContent">

If you’ve only been making use of emails, it is important to understand
that this will be a drag on the productivity of your employees. As
emails demand high levels of reactivity, they are also known to increase
stress among employees. Visual communication and interaction, on the
other hand, helps you have both casual as well as formal communication
with your employees. This, in turn, helps foster a strong bond between
you and your team. A healthy and interactive working relationship
definitely fast-tracks workflow at the end of the day.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Recognize Individual Milestones and Failures**



<div class="panelContent">

It is a universally accepted fact that employees' morale gets a boost
when employers appreciate them as people first and then as employees.
You can choose to recognize personal milestones while appreciating
privacy. It is always advisable to respond with immense consideration
and kindness. By being a supportive employer, you can always boost the
productivity of your employees.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Increase Job Satisfaction of Employees**



<div class="panelContent">

By adopting a few strategies, you can nurture a positive relationship
with your employees. Paying for transportation, gym membership, child
crèche etc. definitely helps boost employee morale and increases the
job satisfaction of employees. Again, for instance, if your company has
a partnership with other organizations, it will be a smart decision to
ask them for mutual discounts on the services that they offer to your
employees.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Provide Substantial Bonuses**



<div class="panelContent">

Giving unexpected and unconditional gifts to employees leads to an
increase in their productivity. Substantial bonuses always have a
positive impact on a workforce. Imagine the positive impact it would
have on a single working mother supporting a family or a fresher who is
struggling to pay off their education loan. Unconditional gifts can
definitely boost the morale of remote workers and increase their
productivity.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Lunch and Learn**



<div class="panelContent">

Lunch and learns encourage employees to share their thoughts and ideas
in a more relaxed, casual environment at lunchtime. They aim to enhance
the skills, knowledge, thinking, and learning abilities of employees.
They are provided in an informal setting that employees appreciate,
learning something new and interesting.

Lunch and learns are also an opportunity to build teamwork and a
positive work culture or environment for employees. Their purpose is to:

  - Enhance employee learning about topics that are ancillary to work
    topics
  - Develop employee knowledge about life skills, the world, and other
    topics of interest
  - Provide a reason for employees to gather to **enhance teamwork** and
    company values
  - Raise employees' level of engagement and motivation at work by
    providing onsite education
  - Increase employees' ability to grow as well as contribute to their
    company's success

The “get-by” employee



<div id="expander-content-1923107376" class="expand-content">

Let’s define what a “get-by” employee is first. They are someone who
barely makes deadlines. The person who always uses their 5-minute grace
period, and who always volunteers for the part of the project that
doesn’t require much effort. An employee like this is just getting by.
They’re skating through their career — doing just enough to keep their
job.

A team that has a get-by member is frustrated because that employee
doesn’t pull their weight. While everyone else is working hard, they are
smooth sailing. No one hires a person to do the bare minimum. So why
would you keep a team member that does the bare minimum? Let this
employee go.

<div id="expander-content-162826347" class="expand-content">

Toxic [employees](https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/toxic-employee) fly
under the radar with management. They have a Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde [personality](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/18-free-personality-tests-that-are-actually-fun),
but the manager can’t see it. All they see is someone who is a great
team member, who works hard and who always raises their hand for
something. But when their manager is gone, this person flips. If you
notice you have a team member who always rotates in and out of certain
circles in the office, whose work-friends are ever-changing or who goes
through periods by themselves, they may be a toxic employee.

Toxic employees affect new hires more than anything. New hires barely
have opinions on the company, department and team; the toxic employee
shapes this opinion. Let them go before they can.

The fake success story



<div id="expander-content-47810858" class="expand-content">

A
fake [successful](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/how-to-be-successful) employee
is someone who gets lucky at work. They answered the phone at the right
time. They approached the right customer. They got the “good” part of
the project. It’s someone who doesn’t have to work hard to make it seem
as if they are working hard. Make sense?

So, why would you fire this person if they are successful? Great
question\! Because they do not know how to do the job. Things have
fallen into their lap because of their luck. They answered the phone and
landed a major deal,
and [leadership](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/definition-of-leadership) now
believes they have the skills to go out and get more business or
clients. They are assigned to train new hires because they are seen as
successful when they don’t have a story to tell. And most importantly,
they do not know how to
handle [failure](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/i-feel-like-a-failure).

When the fake successful person gets their first significant challenge
or loss, they do not know how to handle it. And usually, they do not
make it much longer. They’ve been riding a high for so long, that they
don’t know how to handle the downward slopes. Let them go before this
happens.

This final type might come as a shock, but a manager’s best relationship
is usually not the hardest working person. And if they are, it may be
because they fall into one of the categories above. For instance, the
get-by employee loves to be close to management. If they are close to
their manager, they can get first pick at projects and appear to[ have
it all](http://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/having-it-all) together.
The toxic employee will have the biggest smile in the room, the best
ideas and will want to lead the team in assignments. It’s a way to stay
in control. And the fake successful person?

The hardest people to fire are top producers and employees. But if you
are a manager, this the person you should pay the most attention to.
Their peers will naturally want to be next to them and learn from them,
so make sure they can set a good example and help actually train
and [mentor](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/what-is-a-mentor) others.

Being a manager is tough, but you wouldn’t be in the job if you couldn’t
handle it. Lean on your team members to support. They see things way
before you do. You would be surprised how much happens right under your
nose.

**Management**



<div class="panelContent">

Traditionally, organisational researchers have primarily been focused on
identifying the qualities and traits of individuals that characterise
effective leadership. However, there is an increasing consensus among
scholars and practitioners that, to understand why leadership can
sometimes result in destructive outcomes, we must focus on understanding
the qualities and traits of individuals that characterise dysfunctional
leadership styles.

Previous research has suggested that dark personality traits, such as
narcissism, Machiavellianism or psychopathy –the Dark Triad –may be one
such cause for dysfunctional leadership. As part of a research team at
Alliance Manchester Business School, we explored the implications for
employees and organisations across two of these traits – leader
psychopathy and leader narcissism. Psychopathy encompasses traits
relating to callousness, manipulativeness, impulsivity, and poor
behavioural control, while narcissism is typified primarily by feelings
of entitlement, grandiosity, self-love and a need for admiration.

Across our three studies, drawing on an international sample of more
than 1,200 employees from a variety of different industries and
organisations, we found that, as the levels of psychopathy and
narcissism increased among leaders, so too did the prevalence of
workplace bullying, counterproductive work behaviour, job
dissatisfaction, psychological distress and depression among subordinate
employees.

What was perhaps most interesting about our findings was that workplace
bullying emerged as a mediating mechanism, through which leader
psychopathy and narcissism seemed to affect employee job satisfaction,
wellbeing, depression, and counterproductive work behaviour.

We know that bosses high in psychopathy and narcissism have a strong
desire for power and often lack empathy. This can result in these
individuals taking advantage of others, taking credit for their work,
being overly critical, and generally behaving aggressively in order to
achieve their desired outcome.

We also know, from previous research, that these individuals have
reputations for being bullies, and are likely to engage in bullying
behaviours more frequently than individuals low in psychopathy or
narcissism. However, our results suggest that in addition to the
negative consequences for their psychological wellbeing and job
satisfaction, employees who find themselves in such a working
environment are more likely to retaliate by redirecting their resulting
frustration at either the organisation (resulting in more
counterproductive work behaviours) or their fellow employees (resulting
in an increase in employee-employee bullying as well as leader-employee
bullying).

Our research highlights the need for organisations to consider the
darker side of personality, particularly when selecting individuals for
leadership positions. But, if organisations are able to implement
effective interventions targeted at managing workplace bullying, then at
least some of the destructive consequences of psychopathic and
narcissistic leaders might be diminished.

Good Developers Are Practical Not Emotional



<div id="expander-content-617977811" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

In short, it is not the problem itself but our reaction to it that
causes misery in our lives.

That said, a developer’s life can be challenging at times. Unrealistic
deadlines, overcommitting superiors, the loving code crafted by you
which does not work in production or worse still, your loving code
screwed up mercilessly by a novice developer. The situations that can
cause distress are endless.

Breaking down and letting your anger get the best of you often turn out
to be stupid and immature in most of the cases. Granted, life doesn’t
always throw us pleasantries, but also disappointments which we
definitely have to learn to deal with. On the other hand, avoiding the
problems or blaming it on others is also not a viable solution.

A developer needs to practically respond (*stop and think about what he
needs to face*) to situations instead of reacting to them. Doing this,
we will develop the right attitude to enrich his life, despite the
challenges thrown at him.

The key is to experience uncomfortable emotions but not get stuck in
them. Emotions have the ability to cloud our judgment. And just like any
other skill, managing your emotions and being practical in times of
stress is a hallmark of a good developer.

And here are some ways in which it can be done.

## Challenge the deadlines

By challenging the deadlines, I do not mean refusing it outright or
fighting with your superior or client. Challenging means to take a
proactive solution-based tone while reacting to unreasonable deadlines.

Some of the ways can be.

  - Work backward from the deadline and map out realistically as to how
    much work can be done by you or others and by when.
  - Highlight the dependencies carefully well in advance. For
    example, *“I can finish the code for the loans module but the ATM
    switch code needs to be in place before that.”*
  - Break the deadline up into a series of small milestones and set
    yourself a deadline for each. This will keep you motivated and on
    track towards the final deadline.
  - The key to questioning deadlines is educating yourself about the
    real purpose. Is there any pressing need for this urgency? Are they
    aware of the quality impact of the deadline? Are they lacking any
    information which they should know? Question the intent until you
    can get the real reason and suggest a solution towards it.
  - Lastly say ‘NO’ if the deadline is really unreasonable. Your
    superiors will respect you more if you insist on quality rather than
    compromising on a rush job.

Remember at the end of the day you are a professional and a professional
does the right thing always even in situations when he is under pressure
to do the wrong. Be a professional.

## Prioritize ruthlessly

Good developers know the art of prioritization very well. They don’t get
overwhelmed by urgency.

For example, you are working on getting the production code ready for
the loan origination system and the most important thing for you should
be to get the work done for the client when they are expecting it.
During your programming time, you will get several other activities like
meetings, discussion of other areas, presales discussions with
prospective clients, etc. You need to make sure that each of these
‘other’ tasks does not interfere with your ability to meet the
deadlines of the project.

An easy approach to prioritize work will be the follow the
urgency-important matrix.

  - **Urgent and Important** — Topmost priority
  - **Urgent and not important** — Calls, meetings and any activity
    which is not helping you to meet your deadline. Postpone them.
  - **Important but not urgent** — Can wait or can be delegated.
  - **Not important and not urgent** — Don’t waste your time on this.

And if interruptions go beyond your control, consider using an
‘out-of-office’ message stating that you are in an important work and
will only be available after so-and-so date. Sometimes there is no harm
to be unavailable.

## Decide to Have a Growth Mindset

Neuroscience says the only way to deal with fear: you need to face it,
head-on. When we avoid scary things we become more scared. When you face
your fears they become less frightening.

And to face fear, you need to have a growth mindset. When you are
dealing with a difficult situation, too often your confidence takes a
knock and you tend to underestimate your capability to deliver. To
counteract this, cultivate a growth mindset.

Honor the strength of your past. Remember the struggles and the effort
put in by you that made you such a great developer. Create a long list
of all of your strengths and achievements. If we respect ourselves and
honor our strengths, we automatically become stronger and wiser in times
of struggle.

And rather than focusing on the difficulties you are facing, focus on
what the experience can teach you. Make a conscious effort to absorb the
learnings rather than getting bogged down by frustration.

And remember to have a moral compass in place. Good developers have a
strong sense of right and wrong. If things are wrong, ‘stick your neck
out’ and do the right thing despite told otherwise.

## Communicate, Communicate and Communicate

Communication. It’s about honesty. It’s about treating people in the
organization as deserving to know the facts. You don’t try to give them
half the story. You don’t try to hide the story. You treat them as…as
true equals, and you communicate and communicate and communicate.

If you have important information to share with your boss, colleagues,
vendors — even if it’s not great news — don’t wait. If you put off
providing them with actionable information until it’s too late to act,
then your news will never be well received, whether it’s good or bad.

In almost every conceivable scenario, it’s to your advantage to
communicate as quickly as possible, allowing everyone involved to
understand and digest the information, formulate an appropriate
reaction, and respond accordingly. If it is bad news, your early warning
just might allow for sufficient planning to minimize the damage.

Above all, remain professional, polite, direct, and clear. Remember,
Professionalism: it’s NOT the job you DO, it’s HOW you DO the job. As a
developer, you need to do your best work even if circumstances are not
favoring it. That is your forte; your unique selling point, your
indomitable attitude and never dilute it what so ever.

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Dimensions That Deliver High Performance**



<div class="panelContent">

A team is more than a group of people who work together. A high
performing team is a group of people who share a common vision, goals,
metrics and who collaborate, challenge and hold each other accountable
to achieve outstanding results. You know a high performing team because
the members:

  - Have a clear and vision of where they are headed and what they want
    to accomplish
  - Are excited about that vision because they took part in creating it
  - Act from clearly defined priorities
  - Have clear measures of success and receive feedback about how
    they’re doing
  - Maintain open communication and positive relationships with each
    other
  - Identify and solve problems
  - Make decisions when and where they occur
  - Successfully manage conflict
  - Share leadership responsibilities
  - Participate in productive meetings
  - Have clearly defined roles and work procedures
  - Cooperate cross-functionally

Solid teams are the foundation of a high performance organization and
developing those teams is an effort that requires serious effort and
consistent discipline. The modules in this program are not
informational. They walk a team, step-by-step, through a process to take
responsibility to become a high performing team that takes full
responsibility for their business results.

## Formula for Building High Performance Teams

> Performance = Team Potential — Outside Interference

### Outside Interference

Interactions and interference from outside of the team can impede on a
team’s ability to deliver on its goals.

  - *Changing goal posts*

A moving target is considerably more difficult to hit than a static one.
Changing a team’s goal halfway through the course can kill momentum,
have an impact on morale, and requires a boost to propel the team onto
the new course. In the past, the lack of a long-term vision caused me to
change the goals of my team quite frequently. This led to great
frustration within the team and ultimately decreased performance.

  - *Leadership changes*

Changes in leadership can bring a lot of anxiety within a team. The
anxiety often stems from the uncertainty of what changes will be put in
place by the new leader of the team, department, or function. The new
leader often needs to go through a round of trust-building exercise with
every team member, while important and necessary, often slows the team’s
delivery.

  - *Organizational changes*

Similar to leadership changes, changes in organizational structure can
have a direct or indirect impact on a team. Mergers and/or splits
between departments directly impact the teams under them. Re-alignment
needs to occur, new goals have to be set, and current goals may change.
The departments not directly involved in the organizational change may
have to revisit how they collaborate with the ones that are. Amidst all
the changes, individual team performance is affected.

  - *Micromanagement*

Engineers hate being micromanaged, plain and simple. Anytime I tried to
micromanage, or get too deep into the weeds, it resulted in frustrations
and ultimately the team slowed down. Give the team a clear problem to
solve, a clear direction, and get out of their way.

  - *Inter-team interference*

In any engineering group comprised of multiple teams working on the same
code base or product, no one team can operate fully in a silo. The
reality is, a team often has to collaborate with other teams in order to
get their own work done. In this scenario, it is very common for the
teams to step on each other’s toes which impacts overall delivery. An
engineer can be blocked waiting for a pull request from another team. A
team can deploy code that introduces a bug in a part of the application
which is owned by a different team. An engineer can be blocked waiting
for a code review from another team. These are some instances of common
inter-team interference that I have observed occur. Proper process and
guidelines can help alleviate such inter-team frictions.

<div id="expander-content-1209476860" class="expand-content">

Team Leaders Resolve Conflicts And Increase Cooperation



<div id="expander-content-1407017558" class="expand-content">

Conflicts can tear teams apart and leaders need to work to help resolve
differences quickly and promote cooperation. Often team leaders assume
that mature people will resolve conflict on their own. If that were
true, however, there would be no divorce, separations or wars. In
high-performance teams differences are addressed quickly and directly.
This requires a level of maturity in team members. When people believe
that they are trusted and others have their back, disputes can be
resolved. Team leaders that focus on competition versus cooperation
never achieve outstanding results.

Team Leaders Set Stretch Goals



<div id="expander-content-981843654" class="expand-content">

Leaders who know how to set stretch goals create an internal drive in
the team to accomplish the impossible. People don’t really want to come
to work and do something that any other team could accomplish; they want
to do something extraordinary. When they accomplish something that is
extraordinary they recognize that they personally are capable and
competent. Doing something out of the ordinary helps people recognize
that they are exceptional and their satisfaction with work, their
engagement and pride all go up.





<div id="expander-650040933" class="expand-container">

Team Leaders Communicate, Communicate, Communicate The Vision And
Direction



<div id="expander-content-650040933" class="expand-content">

Be a broken record and help team members to be focused on the vision.
High-performance team leaders stay on message, they constantly
communicate and keep people focused on the vision and mission to
accomplish. It’s easy for anyone to get distracted or miss a turn. Shiny
objects are all around us and sometimes team members get diverted from
their mission. High-performance team leaders keep people informed,
up-to-date and on track.

A strong purpose fuels the passion of your employees, and propels them
out of bed every morning, excited about the work ahead. No matter what
your organization does, there is a higher-level raison d’être that can
activate employees to understand how critical it is that you succeed.
Without your organization, hundreds, thousands or millions of people
would endure unnecessary challenges that make life less gratifying. If
you don’t have a clear purpose, then keep asking yourself why your
organization matters until you can articulate a very high level problem
that your customers, their customers, or the world would face if you
ceased to exist.

As a leader, it is your responsibility to ensure that your entire
organization knows your purpose, strategy, and how you plan to get
there. Employees also need to know their department’s strategy and
plans, and understand what success means.





<div id="expander-551318546" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-551318546" class="expand-control">

Team Leaders Are Trusted



<div id="expander-content-551318546" class="expand-content">

If a team leader is not trusted, they can’t be inspiring or trusted to
resolve conflicts, get the team to embrace stretch goals or believe
their communications. The lack of trust slows down everything. We have
found that there are three basic pillars that build trust. The first
pillar of trust is relationships. We trust people that we like. We trust
our friends and we distrust our enemies. Building a positive
relationship increases trust. The second pillar of trust is knowledge or
expertise. We trust people that have the right answer or can provide
insight. We trust people when they can help solve problems. Use your
knowledge and skills to help others solve a problem and it will increase
trust. The third pillar of trust is consistency. When you say you will
do something and you do it, people trust you. Being consistent and
walking your talk makes you a person that can be trusted.

Many leaders feel pressure to immediately begin making changes during
their first days on the job. While acting quickly gives your higher-ups
the confidence that you are capable of adding value from day one, it
frequently creates barriers and blockers further down the road. This
desire to act swiftly, while in good faith, often communicates a lack of
regard for existing structures, and tells your team that you don’t think
they are smart enough to have thought through their prior decisions and
actions. In my experience, this is one of the fastest ways to lose trust
and put team members on the defensive, creating an unnecessary need to
save face, and making it harder for new leaders to gain the support of
their teams when they begin implementing required changes.

When people see their leader show up with an open mind, and respect for
all the work that has been done, they feel more comfortable buying into
the recommended changes.

<div id="expander-control-108780662" class="expand-control">

Create Psychological Safely



<div id="expander-content-108780662" class="expand-content">

Many people work in fear, afraid of making mistakes or showing
vulnerability, because these things are associated with losing their job
or losing influence.

When people do not feel psychological safety at work, they take fewer
risks, critical questions are not surfaced, difficult conversations are
avoided and innovation is stifled. Too many decisions require
intervention from senior leaders. This forces senior leaders to expend a
lot of their time on less critical issues that could easily be
delegated, rather than focus on higher-impact challenges and
opportunities.

Conversely, in organizations that create psychological safety people
know that if they make a mistake or have shortcomings, they will be
supported and not reprimanded. While writing this article, I faced a
severe case of writer’s block. I struggled for a few weeks, and felt too
embarrassed to ask for help — after-all I’m supposed to be a leader who
knows this stuff. I eventually got over my insecurity and tweeted my
challenge; within 24 hours three colleagues at work had spent hours with
me on a weekend to help me assemble my thoughts into a first draft. I
never felt that any of them would judge me, and that level of
psychological safety allowed me to share something I’m struggling with.

## Increase psychological safety on your own team

### Approach conflict as a collaborator, not an adversary.

We humans hate losing even more than we love winning. A perceived loss
triggers attempts to reestablish fairness through competition,
criticism, or disengagement, which is a form of workplace-learned
helplessness. That true success is a win-win outcome, so when conflicts
come up, he avoids triggering a fight-or-flight reaction by asking, “How
could we achieve a mutually desirable outcome?”

### Speak human to human

Underlying every team’s who-did-what confrontation are universal needs
such as respect, competence, social status, and autonomy. Recognizing
these deeper needs naturally elicits trust and promotes positive
language and behaviors. Reminded the team that even in the most
contentious negotiations, the other party is just like them and aims to
walk away happy. He led them through a reflection called “Just Like
Me*,”* which asks you to consider:

  - This person has beliefs, perspectives, and opinions, just like me.
  - This person has hopes, anxieties, and vulnerabilities, just like me.
  - This person has friends, family, and perhaps children who love them,
    just like me.
  - This person wants to feel respected, appreciated, and competent,
    just like me.
  - This person wishes for peace, joy, and happiness, just like me.

### Anticipate reactions and plan countermoves

“Thinking through in advance how your audience will react to your
messaging helps ensure your content will be heard, versus your audience
hearing an attack on their identity or ego,”  

Skillfully confront difficult conversations head-on by preparing for
likely reactions. For example, you may need to gather concrete evidence
to counter defensiveness when discussing hot-button issues. Leaders
should, “If I position my point in this manner, what are the possible
objections, and how would I respond to those counterarguments?” He says,
“Looking at the discussion from this third-party perspective exposes
weaknesses in my positions and encourages me to rethink my argument.”

Specifically, he asks:

  - What are my main points?
  - What are three ways my listeners are likely to respond?
  - How will I respond to each of those scenarios?

### Replace blame with curiosity. 

If team members sense that you’re trying to blame them for something,
you become their saber-toothed tiger. John
Gottman’s [research](https://www.gottman.com/blog/transforming-criticism-into-wishes-a-recipe-for-successful-conflict/) at
the University of Washington shows that blame and criticism reliably
escalate conflict, leading to defensiveness and — eventually — to
disengagement. The alternative to blame is curiosity. If you believe you
already know what the other person is thinking, then you’re not ready to
have a conversation. Instead, adopt a learning mindset, knowing you
don’t have all the facts. Here’s how:

  - State the problematic behavior or outcome as an observation, and use
    factual, neutral language. For example, “In the past two months
    there’s been a noticeable drop in your participation during meetings
    and progress appears to be slowing on your project.”
  - Engage them in an exploration. For example, “I imagine there are
    multiple factors at play. Perhaps we could uncover what they are
    together?”
  - Ask for solutions. The people who are responsible for creating a
    problem often hold the keys to solving it. That’s why a positive
    outcome typically depends on their input and buy-in. Ask directly,
    “What do you think needs to happen here?” Or, “What would be your
    ideal scenario?” Another question leading to solutions is: “How
    could I support you?”

### Ask for feedback on delivery. 

Asking for feedback on how you delivered your message disarms your
opponent, illuminates blind spots in communication skills, and models
fallibility, which increases trust in leaders. Closes difficult
conversations with these questions:

  - What worked and what didn’t work in my delivery?
  - How did it feel to hear this message?
  - How could I have presented it more effectively?

For example, Asked about his delivery after giving his senior manager
tough feedback. His manager replied, “This could have felt like a punch
in the stomach, but you presented reasonable evidence and that made me
want to hear more. You were also eager to discuss the challenges I had,
which led to solutions.”

### Measure psychological safety.

Periodically asks his team how safe they feel and what could enhance
their feeling of safety. In addition, his team routinely takes [surveys
on psychological
safety](http://www.midss.org/content/team-learning-and-psychological-safety-survey) and
other team dynamics. Some teams at Google include questions such as,
“How confident are you that you won’t receive retaliation or criticism
if you admit an error or make a mistake?”

If you create this sense of psychological safety on your own team
starting now, you can expect to see higher levels of engagement,
increased motivation to tackle difficult problems, more learning and
development opportunities, and better performance.

<div class="panelContent">

Promotions are particularly powerful indicators of what your company
rewards. When someone gets promoted, other colleagues look to understand
how that person achieved the promotion, and draw valuable insights about
your company’s reward system and values.

When an individual is performing highly and upholds company values, a
promotion reinforces your high-performance culture. Conversely, when an
individual is not performing well, or disregards the company’s values, a
promotion signals to everyone else that your values and high-performance
culture are phoney.

Similarly, when high-performing, values-aligned employees get passed
over during promotions, without compelling reasons, it creates ambiguity
about what people really need to do to get rewarded. The same principle
applies to terminations.

**What You Will Do...**



<div class="panelContent">

  - Participate in team building activities and learn how teams differ
    from traditional work groups.
  - Create a team charter that includes a clear statement of your team’s
    purpose, operating guidelines, performance objectives, and an ideal
    team vision.
  - Learn good meeting management skills, critique your meeting
    effectiveness, and develop action plans to improve your meetings.
  - Identify your team’s customer requirements and how these guide team
    performance.
  - Analyze and streamline the core work of the team.
  - Clarify team member roles and responsibilities and ensure greater
    accountability.
  - Set up systems for measuring your performance, setting goals, and
    tracking progress.

High performance team generate commitment. They provide the structure
and a common vision that inspire people to give their best effort.

**Personalisation**



<div class="panelContent">

Just as companies create personalised experiences for customers to boost
sales, these same companies could benefit from creating personalised
experiences for their employees to boost output.

But what does personalisation mean in the context of the workplace?

**It’s about designing spaces that suit employee personas, providing
technology that helps individuals perform, and creating meaningful
experiences.    **

With the trend of personalisation set to flow over to the working world,
companies should explore the following ways to create more meaningful
experiences for their employees.

<div id="expander-288125863" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-288125863" class="expand-control">

Space for everyone



<div id="expander-content-288125863" class="expand-content">

A personalised workspace used to mean having photos of your family and
various personal items on your desk. However, these days as open plan
offices and activity-based working become the norm, a personalised
workspace is more about design that caters to employees' physical and
psychological needs.

Everyone has a different way of working. Some people like to work in
busy collaborative areas and others prefer individual spaces for deep
concentration. A [2016
study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122415622391) by
the American Sociological Review found that when people control when and
where they work they become more productive, healthier, and happier.

Companies that understand their employee’s personas and working styles
can design office spaces that suit them. This in turn creates a more
engaged workforce, which results in higher employee output and
retention.

Things to consider:

  - When redesigning your office, start by consulting your employees to
    find out what they want. [Sendero
    Consulting](https://www.bisnow.com/dallas-ft-worth/news/office/want-to-design-the-perfect-office-ask-your-employees-for-advice-87337?utm_source=CopyShare&utm_medium=Browser) did
    just that to great effect.
  - Map out the different types of personas in your company (i.e. the
    split of introverts vs extroverts) and design accordingly.

Automated Experiences



<div id="expander-content-355007525" class="expand-content">

Advances in technology, such as high-speed Wi-Fi networking and sensors,
are creating new opportunities to personalise the workplace. Intelligent
technology solutions can be adapted for individual situations, saving
people time and making them more efficient.

Fully automated meeting spaces are still in their infancy, but sensors
are already being used to automatically adjust lighting and temperature
as employees enter meeting rooms. It won’t be long before rooms will be
able to detect and optimise the sensory experience for employees.
A [project at
MIT](http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-media-lab-smart-office-mediated-atmospheres-0713) is
already exploring this using bio sensors and machine learning.

[55 million workplace meetings happen every
day](https://blog.lucidmeetings.com/blog/fresh-look-number-effectiveness-cost-meetings-in-us) in
the US alone, and personalised solutions that can make these experiences
more efficient are becoming very popular. At Sony we have developed a
room booking solution, [TEOS Book](http://bit.ly/2zluWmq), which
automatically shows your meeting details on an interactive tablet that
can be used to extend or find other meeting rooms. Employees can also
use a mobile app, [TEOS Mobile](http://bit.ly/2L04SUB), that gives them
full control over their meeting management and a view of personal
statistics.

![TEOS Manage advanced workplace management

To fully take advantage of smart technology solutions companies should
invest in a workplace management system that can aggregate office data,
create smart actions, and automate targeted messaging. At Sony we
recently worked on a project where the Dutch Charity Lotteries wanted to
easily automate and personalise signage for visitors attending events at
their offices, for menus at their canteen, and to show live results and
dashboards at their call centre. They were able to bring this vision to
life with our workplace management solution, [TEOS
Manage](http://bit.ly/2KWQDzW), and [BRAVIA Professional
Displays](https://pro.sony/en_GB/products/professional-displays/ten-reasons-to-love-bravia).

Things to consider:

  - Explore technologies such as sensors and workplace management
    solutions that can help employees get the most out of the spaces
    around them.

Freedom to Choose



<div id="expander-content-1493528026" class="expand-content">

Giving employees more flexibility to choose how they work can increase
productivity and satisfaction. A [study by
EY](https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Global_generations_study/$FILE/EY-global-generations-a-global-study-on-work-life-challenges-across-generations.pdf) of
10,000 employees found that flexibility is almost as important as a
competitive salary.

I covered workspace design earlier, but the same flexible mindset should
also be applied to the technology tools employees can use. [Research has
shown](https://go.apperian.com/rs/300-EOJ-215/images/Apperian%202016%20Executive%20Enterprise%20Mobility%20Report_FINAL_20160216.pdf?aliId=16373787) that
employees not only work faster when using their personal devices (BYOD),
but they feel empowered by the flexibility it gives them.

Giving employees the option to provide feedback on new workplace
technology or processes lets them be heard and improves satisfaction.
Weight Watchers use touch screens outside meeting rooms that have an
emoji scale to collect feedback. When they added whiteboards that
displayed meeting agendas in conference rooms, [dissatisfaction
decreased from 44 percent to just 16
percent](https://hbr.org/2016/09/use-subtle-cues-to-encourage-better-meetings).

Things to consider:

  - Is a BYOD policy possible at your workplace? If so, remember to
    first check security and compatibility risks with your IT Manager.
  - Use a survey solution to gauge employee satisfaction after making
    changes to your workplace.

**Personalisation**



<div class="panelContent">

When it comes to personalised experiences, technology definitely has its
benefits. However, it also has its limitations. Companies shouldn’t
forget the importance of good old-fashioned human interaction.

If a workforce was only communicating digitally employees would feel
isolated, and social relationships that are vital for satisfaction would
be damaged. There’s a well-known study, [the Grant
Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Study), that followed the
lives of 268 Harvard undergraduates over 75 years and it showed the
strongest predictor of satisfaction wasn’t their career achievements or
earnings, but instead the strength of their relationships.

[A more recent
study](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/no-employee-is-an-island/) by
Wharton Business School of 700 employees and managers found that
loneliness was directly linked to poor performance. 

Though our workplace is increasingly dominated by technology, leaders
and managers must find ways to build personal human relationships with
their employees. We all crave this\!

Things to consider:

  - When possible, opt for face-to-face conversations instead of sending
    emails or messages (and [don’t leave your phone on the
    table](https://psmag.com/social-justice/presence-smart-phone-lowers-quality-person-conversations-85805) when
    you do meet in person\!).
  - Invest in getting to know your colleagues on a personal level.
    Taking time to talk and listen will help them feel more fulfilled at
    work.

**Companies need to let go of the one-size-fits-all strategy and cater
to each of their employees individually. A truly personalised workplace
is one that is thoughtfully designed and equipped with smart technology.
It’s a workplace where managers listen to their employees and help them
understand the purpose of their role so that they feel a connection to
their organisation and spaces around them.**

Training for Every Learner



<div id="expander-content-1761582423" class="expand-content">

Let’s focus on four common types of learners: auditory, visual,
writers/readers, and kinesthetic. Auditory learners learn best by
hearing, visual learners do best by seeing, writers and readers do best
by reading, and kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. While people
may lean towards one way of learning over another, most people will
learn best through a combination of these.  
As I learned through my own experience, someone talking to me and
walking me through a hypothetical scenario did help me to learn, but
still left me with terrible gaps and no resources to turn to. Even if
you have stacks of training documents for employees to search through,
that doesn’t mean everything will start making sense to them.

  - **Written documents detailing a process.** These can be short or
    long depending on the subject matter. It should be properly
    formatted so it’s not only easy to read and digest, but employees
    can also easily search through the document to find the specific
    part they’re having trouble with.
  - **Screenshots or video of said processes.** These are supplementary
    for your visual learners. These back up the written details in the
    document. These are particularly helpful for remote workers. While
    you may not have many remote employees yet, the remote-working trend
    has grown by [103%
    since 2005](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/resources/history-remote-workers/),
    so it’s smart to have trainings that can be helpful for those in the
    office and those at home.
  - **A dedicated person who can answer questions during the training
    period.** Too often companies say, “Ask someone on the team if you
    have a question.” This is a terrible waste of time for multiple
    people. What one person is an expert in, another person may only
    have a basic knowledge of themselves. Have a few trusted employees
    who are happy to mentor and also have time to mentor for specific
    tasks, otherwise, you’ll have one employee interrupting others
    workflow.
  - **A time to follow up on training.** Set up a time within the next
    few weeks after the initial training to follow up with your employee
    to see what they retained and what they have questions on. Now that
    they’ve had time to try things out on their own, they’ll be better
    prepared to ask more meaningful questions or clear any remaining
    confusion.

Make a Smart Investment



<div id="expander-content-1599579310" class="expand-content">

When interviewing candidates, imagine them being a part of your
organization years down the road. Don’t just think of them for what you
are hiring them for, think of them as a leader and view them as such. Do
they have that potential?

Sure. You can’t predict the future. But, what’s the point in investing
in an employee if you’ve trained them up for a competitor? Or, what if
they have the talent — but aren’t a good fit for your company culture?
You’re going to not only have to let them go, but you’ll also have to go
through the hiring process all again.

When hiring potential employees, make sure that they possess the skills
that you need both now and in the future. The new employee needs to gel
with your company’s culture and be excited about your products and
services. You should check their references to see if they are
trustworthy and have integrity.

When you find the ideal candidate — do all that you can to retain them.
Paying them a competitive salary and offering perks that they care about
are prominent places to start.





<div id="expander-1867999303" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1867999303" class="expand-control">

Know who they are



<div id="expander-content-1867999303" class="expand-content">

Another way to hold on to your top talent and potential leaders is to
get to know them better. Discover their strengths and weaknesses. Find
out what motivates and interests them inside and outside of work. Stay
connected with them and ask how they’re doing.

Knowing your team on a deeper level creates a more positive work
environment. It also shows that you genuinely care about your employees.
You can also use this knowledge to begin shaping and inspiring them to
become a leader. For example, if they lack communication skills — then
you could show them the basics of nonverbal communication and recommend
that they take a public-speaking class.

Not sure how to do this? Well, you could have informal chats with your
team during breaks. Invite them to lunch or schedule a one-on-one
walking meeting. Ask for their feedback through surveys. And, you could
also have monthly [team-building
activities ](https://www.calendar.com/blog/team-building-activities/)where
you get to understand who they indeed are. You may even get to see their
hidden talents in-action.

Help them Drop bad Habits



<div id="expander-content-32208712" class="expand-content">

“Habits play an important role in our
health,” [says](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2012/01/breaking-bad-habits) Dr.
Nora Volkow, director of NIH’s National Institute on Drug Abuse.
“Understanding the biology of how we develop routines that may be
harmful to us, and how to break those routines and embrace new ones,
could help us change our lifestyles and adopt healthier behaviors.”

At work, you could steer them towards more healthy routines. For
example, you could suggest that they implement a morning routine where
they exercise and eat a healthy breakfast, instead of sleeping in and
grabbing a doughnut. Another idea would be letting them know the
importance of work-life balance by not sending them emails when they’re
not working.

Additionally, you could show your employees how to change their routines
to be more productive. For instance, as opposed to checking your phone
every time you receive a notification, block out specific times for this
action. Encourage them to work on their most important tasks when they
have the most energy.

And, you could also help them break those bad habits that are holding
them back from work. Examples would include never taking breaks, always
being late, making excuses, and preferring only to work alone. You
wouldn’t want to see these habits in an employee, let alone a leader who
is supposed to be setting an example.

“Networking is not only fun but essential to individual growth and
business development,” writes Andre Lavoie in a
previous [*Entrepreneur*](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/242663) article.
“Start small by encouraging networking within the workplace during lunch
hours or at after-work events.” When they feel more comfortable, have
them go outside of your organization by attending industry events.

“Networking will teach them how to forge powerful connections, initiate
conversations with strangers, and act with the confidence of a leader.”
The power of networking can open the door to new business opportunities
and gives your team the chance to exchange ideas. And, “networking can
help turn good employees into great leaders by raising their reputation
within the industry,” adds Lavoie.

Provide Plenty of Opportunites for them to learn



<div id="expander-content-731779331" class="expand-content">

The only way that your employees are going to develop both the hard and
soft skills to become a leader is through proper training. You can’t go
wrong with tried and true techniques like formal education and training.
You could also pay for them to attend workshops and industry events.
Another idea would be to suggest consuming content like books, blogs,
podcasts, or videos that could help them improve upon their weaknesses.

Personally, I learn best by doing. So, delegate some of your
responsibilities to them. You could also let them take over an upcoming
meeting. You’ll want to be there to guide your employees as they
navigate new skills — but allow them to fail a bit. After all, failure
is often the best teacher.

As a leader, [being a

your organization is a must. Besides being beneficial and rewarding on
your end — it’s one of the best ways to boost the careers of your

your knowledge bass to potential leaders.

As a mentor — you’ll help mentees set and achieve short-and-long-term
goals. You’ll also be there to help them work through any difficulties.
And, because you’re their biggest fan, cheerleader, and advocate — you
can motivate and reassure them when they stumble.

If you don’t believe that you have the availability or know-how to be a
mentor — that’s not a problem. Refer this individual to someone who you
think can guide them — don’t just toss them out.

“Your staff needs to know this and learn to navigate the office

How can you achieve this? McCarthy suggests job shadowing and
role-playing as “ways to educate employees about the ins and outs of

I’d also add that you must get everyone on the same page regarding

When your employees aren’t at 100%, either physically or mentally, their
productivity and overall well-being suffer. So, if they’re sick, tired,
and burned out in their current position — you can’t expect them to
thrive in their work now nor the future leadership role. It takes a long
time to rehire — consider keeping your employees well, both mentally and
physically.

[You can encourage your employees to prioritize their
health](https://www.calendar.com/blog/encourage-employees-to-prioritize-health-and-wellness/) by
launching an employee wellness program. You could also promote
preventive care, provide healthy snacks, and encourage them to be more
physically active. Other options would be to show them how to manage
their stress correctly and where to seek help when needed.

Most importantly, I would suggest that you be open about your own health
struggles, especially when it comes to mental health since this will
remove any stigmas. There has been a lot
of [research](https://hbr.org/2019/10/research-people-want-their-employers-to-talk-about-mental-health) showing

very well. You can help your team solve their time management problems
by setting clear expectations and timelines.

Train your employees well in time management right in the beginning and
recommend they conduct a time audits continually. Suggest that they
protect their [maker

As soon as you mention training in a room you can often see eyes glaze
over or glance towards their cell phone, fingers twitching. While
training may not ever be something to be excited about, engagement can

cost-effective.

  - **Section it out into tasks but keep them short**. If it takes an
    hour to go over before the person even has a chance to try out any
    of the concepts, your training is too long.
  - **Keep it flexible, rigidity is the enemy to learning**. Have the
    essential learnings and how you plan to teach them but include time
    for questions and adaptation if things don’t go how you think they
    will. Geraldine Joaquim of Mind Your Business sums this up best, “A
    good trainer will ‘read’ the audience and know if they need to
    tailor their talk, perhaps emphasizing certain aspects that will
    garner more engagement in the subject. This doesn’t mean they miss
    parts of the core content, but there is no point laboring on an area
    that is causing yawns\!”
  - **Engage, engage, engage**. Out of 1,000 office workers, 33% said
    they wanted hands-on experience with what they were being trained
    on. Your employees will be more likely to retain their knowledge if
    they are actively doing the work as it’s being taught to them.
    Include time to let them try out concepts, ask them questions, make
    sure they are on the right path.
  - **Take breaks and be social**. All work and no play makes anyone a
    dull person, so don’t be afraid to share stories, ask the employees
    about them, and ask some questions after every section or before
    starting the next section. Even though training can be boring, that
    doesn’t mean you have to be too.

Engage Employees with Training



<div id="expander-content-1475972170" class="expand-content">

## Make it personal

Typically, making something personal isn’t the best idea – especially in
the workplace. However, when it comes to employee training, the more
personalized you make training, the more likely your employee will
respond positively to training. The best way to do this is to keep the
learner at the center of the training. Pushing learning, especially
learning curriculums that are of a one-size-fits-all variety, is a quick
way to turn your employees off, and even results in an adverse effect on
their work, with time lost and possible feelings of devaluation.

## Ask your employees

Sometimes asking
your [employees ](https://www.lifehack.org/397862/10-ways-to-help-your-employees-have-a-healthy-work-life-balance)can
lead to a dead end, due to the circumstances, office politics, and so
forth. Sometimes you need to intervene and make a decision that’s best
for the company. Training can be like that too. Sometimes you might have
an employee who is good at recognizing their strengths and weaknesses,
and other times you’ll have to step in and offer some guidance.
Regardless of the type of employee, when it comes to training and
self-improvement, it’s always a good idea to ask them first. After all,
it’s important for employees to be engaged. For example, in various
coding classes, there are many ways to help employees retain their
training knowledge, while also being a win-win for the company. This
doesn’t need to be a daunting thing at all. A simple conversation about
personal development goals is likely a conversation that will leave you
both feeling better and it’ll offer clearer insights into how your
employee views their development while also giving you some key insights
into what motivates them and what they see as important.

## Career advancement

If your employee sees a clear path in their professional development
through training, they’re much more likely to be invested in their
training. This can be the outcome of higher wage or even a better
position within the company. In some ways, this is dangling the carrot.
You offer a potential reward, and they’ll do the work to try and achieve
what they need to achieve in order to get that reward. Beware of making
promises you cannot keep, as there’s nothing more demotivating than a
broken promise.

## Multiple formats

The advances in eLearning have been dramatic over the last few years.
With sources such as [Lynda.com](http://Lynda.com) and more, there has
never been a better time to offer eLearning for your employees, which
provides further training without breaking the bank. Combine this with a
BYOD (bring your own device) or a working from home option, and you’ve
got a compelling mix of learning and flexibility that will appeal to
many people. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t offer in-house,
in-person training too. There is still a lot of value to be gained from
learning from each other one-on-one or in a small classroom environment.

## Bake training into the culture

An excellent way to get your employees to respond to training is to make
it a part of your company culture. This doesn’t mean superficially
offering training or forcing unwanted or unnecessary training onto your
employees; it means encouraging people to learn from each other, to make
learning a priority and not a secondary act. Have a centralized
knowledge base, one that is actively maintained and contributed to.
Encourage discussion. Make problem-solving and helping a virtue in your
company, not a taboo. Encourage questions, allow people’s curiosity to
flow, and ask people to punch holes in ideas. This takes everyone to
buy-in if it is to succeed. It’s not a one-off trick and it’s got to
start at the very top.

## Recognize experts when you have them

Sometimes you’ll be fortunate enough to have an expert on your team. No
matter what they’re an expert in, an expert is always a great asset for
a company – when their expertise are used correctly. There are many ways
to utilize expert knowledge within your company, but simply recognizing
when someone is excellent at something and having that information be
known to the rest of your company, is a great way to start. They could
hold a small discussion or a classroom style meeting. They could present
some of their knowledge to the people who are most interested and in
need of their expertise – the list goes on. Regardless of how your
company uses this expert, merely recognizing this person will provide a
boost in morale to everyone.

## Rewards

The final idea on the list appeals to our most basic human selves: a
reward for doing something good. Everyone enjoys a pat on the back now
and then and a pat on the back with a gift card or dinner at a nice
restaurant or a trip to a sporting event are all simple ways to reward
someone for their hard work. These are best presented at milestones, big
or small, and are an excellent way to affirm your employee for the job
they’re doing positively.

<div id="expander-content-809739405" class="expand-content">

Let your managers know that you expect them to coach every direct report
on a regular and consistent basis. To me, the biggest asset you have is
the undeveloped potential of your team members. The leader coach needs
to develop that potential to the fullest extent. Hold them accountable
by asking for a monthly coaching report, and make that activity part of
their annual performance review.

Train them



<div id="expander-content-9645400" class="expand-content">

I find that, unfortunately, most leaders are not organically good at
coaching, because talking about tough topics can lead to conflict with
the person they're coaching. Even qualified leaders often don't know how
to handle it, because they haven't received coaching in their own career
and seen it modeled. Training is essential for developing the competence
and confidence to be an effective coach.

Change their mindset



<div id="expander-content-359594727" class="expand-content">

When I was a vice president in corporate America and asked people to
meet with me, they always thought they were in trouble. Why? Because the
only conversation they had with leaders in the past was disciplinary. I
believe there are two different kinds of coaching: corrective and
developmental. An example of corrective coaching is a discussion to
modify an unproductive behavior, like being late to work too often.
Developmental coaching is talking about someone's career goals and how
to develop the skills, knowledge or expertise to help them get there.
The reality is the leaders need to be having more developmental coaching
conversations. That change of mindset can increase sales, increase
productivity and boost morale.

Reward and incentivize



<div id="expander-content-178889173" class="expand-content">

The reality is humans do what they are rewarded for doing. Put
together a leader's compensation package or provide a bonus for their
role as a coach. Far too often, we reward managers for meeting business
objectives, but don't set or reward coaching objectives. Create a "coach
of the year" award for one manager each year, and generally compliment
leaders for coaching and developing team members. 

The bottom line is, if you want success and growth, you have to coach
the coaches.

Ways to Identify Exceptional Employee



<div id="expander-content-216636484" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

Personality traits form at an early age and are fixed by early
adulthood. Many important things about you change over the course of
your lifetime, but your personality isn’t one of them.

Personality is distinct from intellect (or IQ). The two don’t occur
together in any meaningful way. Personality is also distinct from
emotional intelligence (or EQ), and this is where the study, and most
leaders for that matter, have misinterpreted the term.

![talent](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Ftravisbradberry%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F02%2Ftalent.jpg)

The qualities that leaders in the study called personality were
actually emotional intelligence skills. And unlike your personality,
which is set in stone, you can change and improve your EQ.

Exceptional employees don’t possess God-given personality traits; they
rely on simple, everyday EQ skills that anyone can incorporate into
their repertoire.

Leaders don’t need to go searching for these skills either (though it
doesn’t hurt when you find them); their duty is to help everyone on
their team harness these skills to become exceptional.

Just consider some of the EQ skills that leaders and managers commonly
mislabel as personality characteristics. These are the skills that set
exceptional employees apart.

**They’re willing to delay gratification.** One thing an exceptional
employee never says is, “That’s not in my job description.” Exceptional
employees work outside the boundaries of job descriptions. They’re
neither intimidated nor entitled; instead of expecting recognition or
compensation to come first, they forge ahead in their work, confident
that they’ll be rewarded later but unconcerned if they’re not.

**They can tolerate conflict.** While exceptional employees don’t seek
conflict, they don’t run away from it either. They’re able to maintain
their composure while presenting their positions calmly and logically.
They’re able to withstand personal attacks in pursuit of the greater
goal and never use that tactic themselves.

**They focus.** Student pilots are often told, “When things start going
wrong, don’t forget to fly the plane.” Plane crashes have resulted from
pilots concentrating so hard on identifying the problem that they flew
the plane into the ground. Eastern Airlines Flight 401 is just one
example: The flight crew was so concerned about the landing gear being
down that they didn’t realize they were losing altitude until it was too
late, despite alarms going off in the cockpit. Exceptional employees
understand the principle of “Just fly the plane.” They don’t get
distracted by cranky customers, interoffice squabbles, or switch to a
different brand of coffee. They can differentiate between real problems
and background noise; therefore, they stay focused on what matters.

**They’re judiciously courageous.** Exceptional employees are willing to
speak up when others are not, whether it’s to ask a difficult (or
“embarrassingly” simple) question or to challenge an executive
decision. However, that’s balanced with common sense and timing. They
think before they speak and wisely choose the best time and place to do
so.

**They’re in control of their egos.** Exceptional employees have egos.
While that’s part of what drives them, they never give their egos more
weight than what is deserved. They’re willing to admit when they’re
wrong and willing to do things someone else’s way, whether it’s because
the other way is better or it’s important to maintain team harmony.

**They’re never satisfied.** Exceptional employees have unparalleled
convictions that things can always be better—and they’re right. No one
is ever done growing, and there is no such thing as “good enough” when
it comes to personal improvement. No matter how well things are going,
exceptional employees are driven to improve, without forgetting to give
themselves a healthy pat on the back.

**They recognize when things are broken and fix them.** Whether it’s a
sticky desk drawer or an inefficient, wasteful process affecting the
cash flow of the entire department, exceptional employees don’t walk
past problems. “Oh, it’s been that way forever,” simply isn’t in their
vocabulary. They see problems as issues to be fixed immediately;
it’s *that* simple.

**They’re accountable.** If you’re a manager trying to decipher a
bungled report, “It’s not my fault” is the most irritating phrase in the
English language. Exceptional employees are accountable. They own their
work, their decisions, and all of their results—good or bad. They bring
their mistakes to management’s attention rather than hoping no one will
find out. They understand that managers aren’t out to assign blame;
they’re out to get things done.

**They’re marketable.** “Marketable” can mean many things. Inside the
organization, it means “likeable.” Exceptional employees are well liked
by co-workers. They have integrity and leadership skills (even if
they’re not in an official leadership position) that people respond
to. Externally, it means they can be trusted to represent the brand
well. Managers know they can send these employees out to meet with
clients and prospects without worrying about what they’ll say or do.

**They neutralize toxic people.** Dealing with difficult people is
frustrating and exhausting for most. Exceptional employees control their
interactions with toxic people by keeping their feelings in check. When
they need to confront a toxic person, they approach the situation
rationally. They identify their own emotions and don’t allow anger or
frustration to fuel the chaos. They also consider the difficult person’s
standpoint and are able to find solutions and common ground. Even when
things completely derail, emotionally intelligent people are able to
take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting him or her
bring them down.

**Bringing It All Together**

Take notice of what’s not mentioned: coding skills, years of experience,
business degrees, etc. These things matter, but they won’t make you
exceptional.

*What other qualities make people exceptional? Please share your
thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you
as you do from me.*

**Run Effective Meetings**



<div class="panelContent">

## Set the Agenda

It may seem like an obvious requirement, but a lot of meetings start
with no clear sense of purpose. The meeting’s agenda can be summarized
on a handout, written on a whiteboard or discussed explicitly at the
outset, but everyone should know why they’ve gathered and what they’re
supposed to be accomplishing. **The agenda provides a compass for the
conversation,** so the meeting can get back on track if the discussion
wanders off course. 

If leaders make sure there is an agenda before a meeting starts,
everyone will fall in line quickly.

Have a clear purpose - vague intentions to have a discussion on a topic
rarely end on a productive note. If you are just getting started with
agendas, start with a point form list of topics to be discussed and make
sure that material is provided to attendees at least one day before the
meeting. For better results, provide background information on the
agenda so that everyone attending has the same information.

What about when you are asked to attend a meeting without an agenda?
Ask, “Can you please send me an agenda for the meeting so that I can
prepare?”

**Tip:** For frequently held meetings such as a weekly status meeting on
a project, you can save time by creating a meeting template. Once you
have that in place, preparing an agenda becomes a matter of filling in
the blanks.

## Review The Attendee List

The people in the meeting room make or break your effectiveness. I have
been in MANY meetings where the key person – a manager or executive – is
not present. As a result, no significant decisions can be made.

For Meeting Organizers: limit the number of people attending the
meeting. The purpose of meetings is to make decisions and get work done.
For the most part, meetings are not the best way to simply share
information (exception: meetings are helpful to share sensitive
information)

For Meeting Attendees: read the attendee list before you walk into the
room. Do you see any unfamiliar names? If so, consider looking them up
in your organization’s directory (or on LinkedIn). Surprises are not
your friend when it comes to meetings.

## Manage The Meeting By the Clock

Watching the clock is important in an effective meeting. When nobody
takes charge of managing time, it is easy to become careless and
unfocused. Remember – when people attend a meeting they cannot do
anything else. Make the time count\!

### Meeting Organizer - Start on Time. End on Time.

Nothing can drain the energy from a room quite like waiting for the
person in charge to show up. Why do so many in positions of power fall
into the bad habit of being late for meetings? Is it just that they’re
so busy? Or is there a small thrill in keeping everyone waiting for
them, a reminder that their time is somehow more valuable than everyone
else’s?

Just as important as starting on time is ending on time. A definitive
end time will help ensure that you accomplish what’s on your agenda and
get people back to their work promptly. “I like to have an agenda that
we think through,” Mr. Lundgren added, “and we say, ‘This meeting’s
going to go for two hours,’ and we force ourselves to carve through the
agenda.’”

### Meeting Attendees

Start by arriving early at the meeting (I suggest 5 minutes for in
person meetings and 1-2 meetings for conference calls). That means
avoiding back to back committments on your calendar whenever possible.

## Use The Parking Lot To Manage Off Topic Discussion

This helpful device performs two useful functions:

1.  it serves to keep the meeting focused on the stated agenda
2.  the parking lot acknowledges important points raised by attendees.

Warning: The Parking Lot habit must be combined with the Follow Up habit
if you wish to be truly effective. Otherwise, you are likely to gain a
reputation for simply making a show of acknowledging other people.

As a meeting organizer, here are a few steps to use the parking lot
concept.

1.  At the beginning of the meeting, explain you expect everyone to
    focus their discussions on the agenda. Further, explain that this
    rule will help the meeting stay productive and end on time.
2.  Keep the meeting agenda document in front of you as a guide.
3.  Go through each agenda item
4.  Monitor and contribute to the discussion
5.  When someone raises an interesting point that does not relate to the
    agenda, say the following: “Thank you for that point, Tim. However,
    Microsoft Visual Studio tools go beyond the purpose of this meeting.
    Let me write down that item in the parking lot and I will include it
    in the meeting notes that I will send out by email so we can explore
    that point at the right time.”

## Keep Attendees Engaged

[It’s okay to start the meeting by setting the expectation that everyone
is 100% focused on what’s going on in the room. Let the group know that
if someone has work that is so pressing they’d be tempted to multi-task,
they have permission to go do that work and catch up on what happened in
the meeting later. They’ll produce better work, and you’ll have more
engaged participants.

When I first started facilitating these types of meetings, I ran myself
ragged writing on whiteboards, capturing notes, and moving flip chart
sheets around. I was working up a sweat and everyone else was just
sitting in their chairs. I thought that I needed to be doing all of the
work in order to be a valuable facilitator.

I now know that it's the opposite. I assign roles for the meeting and
make them do the work. They write on the flip charts themselves, I
designate a scribe to take notes, and I even assign someone to be a DJ
to play music during breakout sessions. This keeps them engaged and
moving around and it allows me to focus on observing the team dynamics
and tracking the overall agenda.

## Manage The Team's Energy

One of the main issues with full-day or multi-day meetings is managing
the level of energy in the room. Mental focus and blood sugar level will
wax and wane dramatically throughout the day. It is important to keep
the energy high and avoid running into ruts.

I like to start mornings and afternoons with a physical exercise.
Anything that gets people out of their chairs and moving around is
helpful. For example, I will ask people to stand around a flipchart to
discuss rather than sit in their seats. You can also create exercises
that get people moving around the room or even do breakout sessions
outside so people can walk around. The idea is to keep them moving.

## Take Notes for Yourself

Taking notes in meetings is an essential skill yet I am often struck by
how often people forget to do it. The key reason to take notes in a
meeting is to record any questions or assignments that have been
directed to you. Let’s look at how attendees and organizers can act on
notes.

Take notes in a paper notebook rather than using a computer, tablet or
other device. Even if you have fantastic abilities to focus on the
meeting, other people may assume that you are “catching up on email”
instead of paying attention to the meeting if you take notes on a
computer.

### Meeting Organizers

if you plan to send minutes or a summary of the meeting to attendees,
say this at the start of the meeting and explain what you will include.
Sending out meeting minutes, even a few paragraphs or bullet points, is
a best practice.

### Meeting Attendees

bring a copy of the agenda and use that document to guide your note
taking. Focus on the decisions made in the meeting and items that
require further investigation or action on your part.

## End with an Action Plan

**Leave the last few minutes of every meeting to discuss the next
steps.** This discussion should include deciding who is responsible for
what, and what the deadlines are. Otherwise, all the time you spent on
the meeting will be for naught.

## Follow Up On The Meeting

The art and science of follow up is vital professional habit and it also
matters in the context of meetings. When it comes to meeting tips,
following up in a timely basis is a great way to manage stress and make
a good impression on others. For the best results, I suggest following
up (e.g. making a phone call, writing an email etc) the same day as the
meeting. For very important matters, make a note on your calendar or
task management tool of choice to continue following up until you reach
a resolution.

**Kill Unproductive Meetings**



<div class="panelContent">

Meetings are almost always a huge drain on your time, and should be
killed on sight. 

A productive meeting would be if ideas could be communicated and agreed
upon faster than through phones or email, not longer. A productive
meeting would have a clearly stated purpose, be as short as possible,
and have an outcome with assigned tasks to be completed after the
meeting. **In all the organizations I’ve worked for or been involved
with, those meetings are truly rare — if they even exist.**

Instead, kill the meetings in your life, and get tons more done. Here’s
how:

  - **Don’t hold meetings**. If you’re the boss, or you’re in charge of
    scheduling meetings, you have the authority to cancel them. Try
    going one day without them. Instead, have the same purposes be
    accomplished through email. Do you have a meeting where people give
    you progress reports? Have them email you a progress report daily,
    at a specified time each day, and have your assistant collect them
    compile an overall daily report for you. A meeting at a glance.
  - **Communicate through email, phone, then person-to-person**. Make
    email your default communication mode. If someone wants to set up a
    meeting, ask them to email you with their questions instead. If
    that’s not good enough, agree to talk on the phone about it. As a
    last resort, agree to a 5-minute face-to-face, standing up. Don’t
    agree to coffee or lunch — most of the time, you’re just chit
    chatting. And when you do talk on the phone or in person, get to the
    point quickly — eliminate the preliminary friendly chatting. Just
    dive right in: OK, what needs to be done here? What are we trying to
    accomplish? What tasks will be done by whom? And then you’re done.
  - **Beg off**. If you’re not the boss, you might not control whether
    meetings are held or not. In that case, ask to skip it. Say that
    you’ve got an urgent project on deadline, and you won’t be able to
    make the meeting. If your boss tries to insist that you make it, ask
    if he or she would like to grant you an extension on your project.
  - **Accomplish the agenda**. Before the meeting, ask for a copy of the
    agenda. Then accomplish whatever’s on the agenda before the meeting
    even takes place. For example, if the meeting is to discuss a
    report, annotate the report thoroughly with your comments, and put
    your recommended actions at the bottom. Email that to your boss, and
    say that you’ve already done what’s required, so you can work on
    another project instead. Eliminate the need for you to be at the
    meeting.
  - **The Puppydog Technique**. Tim Ferriss, author of [The 4-hour
    Workweek](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/), suggests that you
    use the Puppydog sales technique to get out of meetings. Basically,
    this technique was originally used by pet shops to make a sale — if
    the customer is wavering, tell them to just take home the puppy and
    give it a try, and if it doesn’t work out, they can bring the puppy
    back. Many people will agree to this little trial — and they rarely
    bring the puppy back. Ask your boss if you can skip the meeting,
    just for today, as you need to finish something urgent. Just this
    once is hard to turn down. Eventually, your boss will realize that
    you don’t need to go to the meeting and that you’re more productive
    if you don’t.
  - **Work from home**. Convince your boss to let you work from home,
    and you can skip all meetings. This, of course, is ideal. Just make
    sure you’re more productive at home than at the office.
  - **Get stuff done**. If you are able to skip a meeting, actually get
    stuff done — important stuff. Be 10 times as productive as the
    people who went to the meeting.
  - **Show proof**. When the boss comes out of the meeting you skipped,
    turn in that big report or project. Show that you were super
    productive without the meeting — with cold, hard proof. Do this
    enough times, and you will impress your boss and the unproductive
    meeting will be a distant memory.

## Team Understanding

  - A good team is formed out of necessity, they work with what they got
    in the skills arena.
  - A superb team understands each members’ psychology. In other words,
    they know how to adjust their communication according to each
    personality.
  - An excellent team grasps the philosophical foundations of the
    member’s decisions making. They understand what makes everyone
    tick.

## Avoidance of Conflict

What often happens in smaller companies and organizations which do not
have a large pool to fish out off, that they use two metrics to create
functional teams.

  - Like in any team, the skill sets have to be diversified, to move
    with greater speed.
  - To then accomplish the increase of pace, compared to that of an
    individual, they strive to align interest as to avoid decision
    fatigue.

Decision fatigue can decrease cognition, productivity, social awareness
of any team member in any kind of team.

Problem is that mutual agreement leads to bias, tunnel vision,
conventional creativity of thought.

Generation Differences



<div id="expander-content-547191743" class="expand-content">

Author:  [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

  

<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Traditionalists**



<div class="panelContent">

Since this generation was born between 1928 and 1945, you don't see many
of them in workplace. However, they still impressively make up around
three percent of the workforce.

This is the generation who firmly believes in an "Honest day's pay for
an honest day's work." They're extremely loyal and enjoy being respected
for that. Since they're conformists, they value most job titles and
money.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Baby Boomers**



<div class="panelContent">

Born between 1946 and 1964, this group is also referred to as the "Me"
generation. They're predominately in their 40s and 50s and are
well-established in their careers. As such, they hold positions of power
and authority, such as law firm leaders and executives.

Boomers are often ambitious, loyal, work-centric, and cynical. They
prefer monetary rewards, but also enjoy non-monetary rewards like
flexible retirement planning and peer recognition. They also don't
require constant feedback and have "all is well unless you say
something" mindset.

Since Boomers are so goal-oriented generation they can be motivated by
promotions, professional development, and having their expertise valued
and acknowledged. Prestigious job titles and recognition like office
size and parking spaces are also important to Boomers.

They can also be motivated through high levels of responsibility, perks,
praise, and challenge.

It's expected that around 70 million Boomers will be retired by 2020.
So, they're also paying attention to 401(k) matching funds, sabbaticals,
and catch-up retirement funding.

They are very competitive, because of their large numbers and they
excel, especially in work situation. They find it difficult, however, to
continue excelling, because of career pressure from younger generations
and their lack of technology knowledge.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Gen X**



<div class="panelContent">

Generation X has around 44 to 50 million Americans who were born between
1965 and 1980. They're smaller than the previous and succeeding
generations, but they're often credited for bringing work-life balance.
This is because they saw first hand how their hardworking parents became
so burnout.

Members of the generation are in their 30's and 40's and spent a lot of
time alone as children. This created an entrepreneurial spirit with
them. In fact, Gen Xers make up the highest percentage of startup
founders at 55 percent.

Even if they're not starting their own businesses, Gen Xers prefer to
work independently with minimal supervision. They also value
opportunities to grow and make choices, as well as having relationships
with mentors. They also believe that promotions should be based on
competence and not by rank, age, or seniority.

Gen Xers can be motivated by flexible schedules, benefits like
telecommuting, recognition from the boss, and bonuses, stock, and gift
cards as monetary rewards.

They are considered skeptical and quick to question, goal-oriented and
multi-taskers. Additionally, they value their freedom, flexibility,
recognition, mobility and diversity. They focus on value, are
financially responsible and self-reliant leading them to respond better
to factual messages that demonstrate cost versus value. It's important
for this generation to get a good value for their hard-earned dollars.
Keeping these attributes in mind, particularly the focus on value, when
crafting your public relations or marketing message.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Millennials (Generation Y)**



<div class="panelContent">

Born after 1980, they tech-savvy generation is currently the largest age
group in the country. They're in their 20's and are beginning to come
into their own in the workforce. They're the fastest growing segment of
today's workforce.

For some Millennials, they're content with selling their skills to the
highest bidder. That means unlike Boomers, they're not as loyal. In most
cases, they have no problem jumping from one organization to another.

That's not to say that you can't motivate this generation because you
can by offering skills training, mentoring, feedback. Culture is also
extremely important for Millennials.

They want to work in an environment where they can collaborate with
others. Flexible schedules, time off, and embracing the latest
technology to communicate are also important for Gen Y.  They want to
provide input and be heard, a tall order when the boss may be decades
older with micromanagement tendencies.

Millennials also thrive when there's structure, stability, continued
learning opportunities, and immediate feedback. If you do offer monetary
rewards, they prefer stock options.

The seeds of miscommunication can be slowed even before a Millennial
comes on board. The best way to address generational issues is to show
there aren't any.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Gen Z**



<div class="panelContent">

This generation is right on the heels of Millennials. And, they're
starting to enter the workplace. Even more interesting, they make-up
one-quarter of America's population, making this generation larger than
baby boomers or Millennials.

This generation is motivated by social rewards, mentorship, and constant
feedback. They also want to be do meaningful and be given
responsibility. Like their predecessors, they also demand flexible
schedules. They are eager for authenticity, they are clever at
streamlining and simplifying procedures. Often have entrepreneurial side
gigs.

Other ways to motivate this generation is through experiential rewards
and badges such as those earned in gaming and opportunities for personal
growth. They also expect structure, clear directions, and transparency.

What's most intriguing about Gen Zers is that 53 percent prefer
face-to-face communication.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Motivating a Multigenerational Workforce**



<div class="panelContent">

"To manage across the generations we have to learn to be mindful of each
other and treat each other as individuals," writes Bruce Mayhew.

"No matter what generation we are from, it's too easy to keep doing what
we are doing now and acting like each generation is (or should be),
motivated by the same things we are.

Even if our professional -; management instincts say 'no -; of course we
don't do this,' we have to be careful that our actions don't demonstrate
that we do. We always have to be mindful of our actions and stay open to
listening to each other."

"Use everyone's ability and goals."

However, it's still your responsibility to make every employee,
regardless of their generation, feel engaged. You also need to integrate
them into your company's culture and make them feel valued.

That may sound like a tall order to fill, but you can achieve that by
first making sure that you've hired the right person for the job. Also
make sure that they're a good fit within your company's culture.

You also need to ensure that there's purpose and meaning behind their
work. Creating and sharing a mission or vision should help them
understand why their job exists.

Don't forget to encourage work-life balance, offer health and welfare
benefits, and provide rewards that *your* employees would care about.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Baby Boomers Manage Millennials**



<div class="panelContent">

Baby Boomers sometimes believe Millennials are entitled and lazy, but
this couldn’t be further from the truth.

Millennials have entered a professional world where their realities are
wildly different from the ones Boomers knew. They prioritize things that
don’t make sense to Boomers because their environment has different
demands.

For example, Millennials expect to be fired or let go regularly, so they
want work that is directly in line with their own career equity, which
are the skills and experiences that help them improve their career
prospects. They know their time is limited, so they don’t invest in
doing things outside their own path. Boomers, however, are used to
working hard for a company in exchange for long-term investment in
skills development and for security, like a retirement fund or pension.

But employment security and long-term investment no longer exist in the
modern working world.

## So what are Millennials working for?

I’ve found they often work incredibly hard. But first, they need to feel
like what they’re working toward aligns with their own goals and
aspirations. Ensured upon hiring them that I knew what they wanted to
build in their careers, and ensure that their role within the company
would amount to that end. This created a management-employee
partnership. They worked hard for my company because they felt they were
getting something out of it that benefitted them.

This may sound foreign to Boomers. They come from a world where they
were expected to pay their dues by working hard on whatever the company
needed, with the expectation that the company would reward them over in
the long-term. Now, Millennials will work hard when they are given
opportunities that help them provide for themselves without any kind of
deal.

In order to bridge this generational divide, we have to update the old
bargain in a way that Boomers can understand and Millennials can use.
That means understanding where both sides are coming from in order to
make the best possible deal.

But first, let’s talk a little further about where Boomers are coming
from.

## Baby Boomers have certain expectations of young employees based on their own experience

Boomers entered a company and were expected to pay their dues in order
to move forward. The understanding was if they worked hard for the
company for several years, and the company benefited from their work,
they’d be rewarded with pay raises and promotions. If they stayed with
the company long enough, they’d have a pension.

This was the bargain struck between an employee and company in the old
days: you work hard and in exchange, we’ll give you security and
stability.

Now, Boomers expect Millennials to work for the same bargain. They think
Millennials want to progress too fast and aren’t paying their dues,
which comes off as lazy. Boomers also assume Millennials are flighty and
don’t stay in their roles with any kind of commitment. What Boomers
don’t realize is the other end of the deal they had, the end that’s
supposed to be a payoff for the employee, isn’t there anymore.

## It’s a whole new world out there, and Boomers have to recognize that if they’re going to successfully manage Millennials

They also have to understand what Millennials actually want.

Because Millennials don’t expect to stay with a company for the long
term, their interest is in what can benefit them now.

This doesn’t come from an inability to commit. It’s the result of
massive turnover rates, an unstable economy, and a more competitive
business environment.

What Millennials are learning from their work experience is they will
inevitably get fired, let go, shut down, or need to look elsewhere for
personal growth. They expect to leave a position in a very short amount
of time, so they want to get paid competitively and want to take on more
responsibility quickly. They treat work as a way to build their own
professional equity and skill set as future bargaining chips so when
it’s time to move on, they’re prepared.

Professional services companies like consulting firms, investment banks
and law firms have already found a way to tap into this mindset by
offering skills development and mentorship. In some ways, they’re
preparing their staff to move on to other companies, but they’re also
getting an intense level of hard work from Millennials in the meantime.
In some cases, the employee feels invested and stays long-term.

Tech companies also understand the benefit of this investment and fight
to recruit then keep Millennial talent. For example, Google also
currently sends employees to conferences and boot camps to improve their
skills. This is another way to tap into Millennial aspirations for a
mutual benefit. The team feels like they’re getting skills they can
apply anywhere, and the company gets a return on their investment.

While this is one example of what a new bargain could look like, it’s
not the only one.

## There are other ways to tap into a Millennial’s aspirations, but they don’t come from mind-reading.

Boomers managing Millennials need to understand their employment
relationship is going to be short, so they have to cut to the point.
Conversations around what the employee wants from a job need to happen
as early as the interview in order to continue motivating throughout the
working relationship.

**Some questions to ask include:**

  - What does the employee want from us?
  - What are we providing the employee in exchange?
  - What does the employee want in the long term? The short-term?
  - What do they want from their career?
  - What kinds of goals do they have outside of work?

Once a Boomer has answers to a few of these, they can start to craft a
mutually beneficial working relationship with their Millennial staff.
This means having regular conversations between employee and employer
about what each side wants from the role going forward and how the two
can help each other in the best way.

One thing I do at Codex Protocol is have monthly meetings with each
employee. We don’t talk about their projects or what they’ve
accomplished. I limit the conversations strictly to what they want going
forward and how I can help them achieve that. I’ve noticed in my
Millennial employees, they work the hardest when I’ve given them chances
to do work, achieve goals, and build their resume toward what they want
long term.

There’s a way to build mutually beneficial relationships between
generations, and it comes from compromise on both sides. When given
tasks that make them feel like they’re building toward something,
Millennials will work to help Boomers’ businesses grow. Bridging the
communication gap between these two generations can lead to greater
outcomes on all sides, and maybe we can finally put a stop to all those
think pieces about Millennial work ethic.

Getting Honest Feedback



<div id="expander-content-164636889" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

According to [research on effective
learning](http://www.columbia.edu/~mvp19/ETF/Feedback.pdf), to improve
performance, people need three things:

  - A clear goal
  - A genuine desire to achieve that goal
  - Feedback that indicates what they are doing well and what they are
    not doing well

Unfortunately, [the feedback many leaders receive is not
helpful](https://hbr.org/2017/10/how-to-give-feedback-people-can-actually-use).
It’s often infrequent, vague, or unrelated to specific behaviors — and
as a result, leaders tend to be less proactive about getting more of it.
Low-quality feedback is not useful, positive feedback is undervalued,
and negative feedback delivered unskillfully can actually [cause
physical
pain.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolefisher/2015/12/25/rejection-and-physical-pain-are-the-same-to-your-brain/#7f72dd0b4f87)

Without clear performance targets and data measuring how close or far
they are from reaching them, leaders will continue to find it difficult
to grow and improve. When delivered thoughtfully, however, feedback can
provide leaders with the actionable data they need to become more
effective.

If you want to get the feedback that is necessary to improve your
leadership, there are a few steps you can take.

<div id="expander-1709519729" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1709519729" class="expand-control">

Build and maintain a psychologically safe environment



<div id="expander-content-1709519729" class="expand-content">

Sharing feedback is often interpersonally risky. To increase the
likelihood of your colleagues taking that risk with you, show them that
their honesty [won’t be met with negative
repercussions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268328210_Psychological_Safety_Trust_and_Learning_in_Organizations_A_Group-level_Lens).
You can do this before you ask for feedback by [being
curious](https://hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it), [rewarding
candor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L80W8N2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),
and showing vulnerability. Being curious starts with having the right
mindset, or believing that you have something useful to learn. It is
demonstrated by asking your teammates open-ended questions that you
really don’t know the answers to: “What could go wrong if we try this?”
When you listen to and genuinely explore your colleague’s different, and
possibly risky, perspectives — even if you disagree with them — you are
rewarding their candor. Acknowledging your weaknesses or mistakes along
the way are great ways to be open and vulnerable.





<div id="expander-1331085996" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1331085996" class="expand-control">

Ask for feedback skillfully



<div id="expander-content-1331085996" class="expand-content">

Asking “What feedback do you have?” rarely elicits a useful response.
Instead, ask about specific events (“What did you hear when I shared my
strategy?”), worrisome patterns (“How often do I interrupt people in
meetings?”), personal impact (“How did it feel to you when I sent that
email?”), and lastly, recommendations (“What can I do to help build my
relationship with Priya?”)





<div id="expander-674269192" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-674269192" class="expand-control">

Request both positive and negative data



<div id="expander-content-674269192" class="expand-content">

Clients tell me all the time that they just want to hear “the bad stuff”
when it comes to feedback. What they fail to appreciate is that positive
feedback that targets a specific behavior is useful. It tells them what
they *don’t *need to work on, and [increases their
motivation](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f08d/2df6098b0e7c03a77302af0b2824ca9f371d.pdf) to
focus on the behaviors that they do. For clarity, positive feedback is
not the same as praise. Praise tells us someone is happy with us and
thinks we are performing well. Praise sounds like: “Nice job\!”; “You
were great in that meeting.”; “Killer presentation\!” While it feels
good, praise does not give us enough information to understand what we
are doing effectively so that we can repeat the behavior.**  
**





<div id="expander-1282918957" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1282918957" class="expand-control">

When receiving feedback, give your full attention and listen carefully



<div id="expander-content-1282918957" class="expand-content">

 Eliminate distractions, including your phone and laptop, and focus
fully on the person giving the feedback. Having your phone present, even
if you’re not looking at it, [negatively impacts relationships and
reduces your ability to connect with
others](https://psmag.com/social-justice/presence-smart-phone-lowers-quality-person-conversations-85805).
Listen carefully to what the other person is saying, resisting the
impulse to evaluate the accuracy of the message.

<div id="expander-content-306968005" class="expand-content">

If you find yourself disagreeing with some feedback, practice
self-awareness and notice this reaction, but do not offer contradictory
evidence or challenge your colleague. If you debate, you will look
defensive and not open to feedback, and you may decrease the likelihood
of that person offering you feedback in the future. None of these are
the outcomes you’re trying to achieve — so don’t do it.**

You may feel happy, angry, confused, or frustrated by what you hear.
Recognize that your reactions are about you, and not the other person.
If you asked for feedback and someone was brave enough and generous
enough to share it with you, it’s your responsibility to own and explore
your reactions. Instead of finding fault in the messenger, become
curious about yourself. Ask: Where is this anger really coming from?
What about this is confusing? What part of the message is actually true
for me, even if I don’t want to acknowledge it?

Say thank you in a way that conveys sincere appreciation. If you’ve
heard something helpful, the person giving you feedback likely spent a
good amount of time considering your performance and how to thoughtfully
discuss it with you. They took a risk by being candid, so let them know
how much you appreciate their effort and courage.

By thinking through the meaning and implication of the feedback, you can
learn from it and consider what parts to work on, what parts to
disregard, and what parts require deeper understanding. To do this, it
helps to think about your development areas, the value you place on this
individual’s perspective, and possibly, what you have heard from others
as well. This is also the time to come back to what you may disagree
with. Given that your objective was to learn others’ perspectives on
you, ask yourself if it’s really worth the potential damage to go back
and “correct” the information. Typically, it’s not.

development, they’re also a signal to those who shared the feedback —
you are serious about improving and you value their perspectives.

Great leaders are great learners. Their never-ending pursuit of
information pushes them to constantly improve and sets them apart from
the rest. Getting and learning from feedback isn’t always easy, but it
is necessary, if we want to become better. It’s rare that our colleagues
will offer us the kind of feedback we need to develop, and also rare
that we respond in a way that rewards their efforts and helps us
improve. It’s worth building the skills to do this well if we want to
reach our full potential.

**Giving Feedback When You're Conflict Averse**



<div class="panelContent">

So what do you do if you naturally avoid conflict but a big part of your
job is giving difficult performance feedback? When you’re worried about
ruffling feathers, how do you provide your direct reports with the input
they need to learn and improve?

The first step is acknowledging your conflict aversion. Have you found
yourself saying any of the following statements in the last six months?

  - *“I believe in giving people chances and investing in them so I want
    to give this more time.”*
  - *“I don’t want to crush the person when he is already working so
    hard. I need him to stay motivated.”*
  - *“My style tends to be more collegial. I prefer to roll up my
    sleeves and help out if someone is having trouble.”*
  - *“The person is so difficult, aggressive, and defensive. I hate that
    kind of conflict.”*

If so, you may be actively avoiding confrontation. Which doesn’t mean
that you have to change your core values–maintaining relationship
harmony is an important part of any job. But you will need to reframe
the way you think about tough feedback. Rather than seeing it as a
potential violation of your values, consider how it could be an
opportunity to put your values to work. Here are some tips for doing
that:

**Don’t delay and make things worse.** Although deferring a difficult
conversation can result in temporary relief, things simmer. Problems get
worse. Projects get off track or fail. We end up putting the business—or
our working relationships–at risk and potentially having to take more
dramatic action than if we had acted earlier. When you find yourself
hesitating to share feedback, ask yourself: What is the business
context? Does it require a swift decision? Be careful that in the effort
to spare the feelings of one individual, you don’t end up hurting the
morale of many others.

Or perhaps you see signs of trouble but are holding back because you
don’t fully trust your instincts. Consider what would boost your
confidence in making the call about when to give tough performance
feedback. What additional information could you collect? What objectives
are at risk? Ultimately, what are the costs if you don’t give this
feedback now?

**Be clear and open. **The good news is that your agreeable demeanor
makes it next to impossible for you to deliver feedback in a belittling
way. So don’t worry about being clear and direct. To keep your critique
from feeling personal, start by sharing the broader business context for
why the feedback matters now. Reassure the person that you know their
intentions were probably good, but that you do have some observations to
share about the effect of their actions. Provide your take on what is
happening for this person today and what needs to be different. Describe
the impact they are having now and what impact they need to have. Allow
time for them to digest the information and ask for their thoughts. Does
this resonate? What is their perspective on the issue? What are they
struggling with?

But don’t stop there. Make sure that you get concrete about the changes
you need to see (in both skills and actions) and articulate clear time
frames. Offer examples of how they might have handled the situation more
effectively. For instance, you might say, “*With the monthly reports, I
need to see you be more proactive and show you are getting in front of
things. *Or, “*When you bring an issue to my attention, also bring a
recommendation to show that you’ve dug into it.”*

In our attempt to avoid conflict, soft-pedaling or sugar-coating might
feel better in the moment, but if we don’t say what needs to be said,
real change will never happen.

**Get comfortable with uncomfortable emotions. **Feedback can
potentially lead to disagreement, hurt feelings, or defensiveness.
Prepare for tough conversations in advance by playing out possible
scenarios so that you’re ready for whatever may occur.

If you or the other person starts to get defensive or emotional,
acknowledge the tension and offer a break. “*I understand how difficult
this must be. What do you need at this point in the
conversation?”* Or,* “This is challenging for both of us. I’d like
to take a break and catch up later today.” *When the going gets tough,
make sure you don’t back-pedal, change your message in an attempt to
diffuse the situation, or start talking too much to fill silences or
plow through the conversation. You want to give the person adequate time
to digest what you are saying.

If they offer new information, take it into consideration. If your
assessment and suggested course of action remain intact, stay on
message. On the other hand, if the new information could significantly
shift your view, it’s best to step back and reassess. You can say, “*I
appreciate your sharing this information. I was not aware of it. I’d
like a chance to look into it. Let’s get together in a few days after
I’ve had a chance to learn more.”*

**Follow up. **Even if the first conversation goes well, you can always
offer to be available for further discussion to ensure a fair
resolution. Loop back to ensure an optimal outcome has been achieved,
both in preserving the message and the relationship.

Being an effective leader requires some level of stepping out of your
comfort zone and a commitment to continually improving your
communication skills. Your preference for harmony can be an asset to the
organization and to your team in the right circumstances—but it can also
backfire if you’re not careful. You can still cultivate positive
relationships by encouraging and cheering others on. But to ensure that
your people are performing at their best, you also have to know when
it’s time to give tough feedback. Stay true to yourself by delivering
it in a clear, respectful way. You may be surprised to find that on a
high-functioning team where feedback is shared honestly, conflict is
minimal.

Manager Handoffs



<div id="expander-content-767502182" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

There are so many potential pitfalls when getting a new manager. Your
new manager might not be familiar with all that you’ve done already,
which could slow your career momentum. You can hope that your former
manager and new manager did a handoff in which they shared lots of
information like your goals, previous achievements, feedback you’ve
received, and anything else that it’s helpful for a manager to know. But
if they *did* have this handoff, it probably happened behind closed
doors - you likely have no idea what was discussed, if everything was
captured, and (the scariest bit) - whether or not the way your former
manager represented things matches how *you* perceive the same things.

An Engineering Director at Etsy showed me a new way to do manager
handoffs that combats these pitfalls: a 1:1:1 (“one to one to one”). A
1:1 is between you and your manager; a 1:1:1 includes both your former
manager, AND your new manager, and is an opportunity to ensure your
career momentum doesn’t experience that hiccup.

<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**What's the goal of 1:1:1 manager handoff**



<div class="panelContent">

You, your previous manager, and your new manager meet in the same room
or video call. Most of the talking happens between the managers, but
there should be clear opportunities for you (the direct report) to jump
in as you feel like it.

The goals are:

  - share relevant information from the previous manager to the new
    manager about the direct report,
  - do this transparently such that the direct report can get a good
    sense of whether there’s things unsaid or things that differ from
    their own perception, with an opportunity to disagree or clarify,
    and
  - reduce the natural career friction, pausing, or hiccups that happen
    when a person gets a new manager.

This is an opportunity to turn an otherwise lossy process into a much
more thorough, supportive process for a direct report.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Agenda**



<div class="panelContent">

Before this meeting happens, either manager should send out an invite
stating expectations for the meeting, what each person should prepare
for it, and what the goal is. Here’s an example:

> Hey *Other Manager* and *Direct Report*\! I’m booking an hour for us
> to do a ‘manager handoff’, with *Direct Report* sitting at the table,
> too\!
> 
> *Former Manager* will cover:
> 
>   - Most recent review cycle feedback
>   - More recent feedback, projects, and other info since the last
>     review cycle
>   - *Direct Report*’s goals, growth areas, things for *New Manager* to
>     know
> 
> *Direct Report*, this will also be an opportunity for you to
> agree/disagree with how these things are described/characterized, and
> also an opportunity for you to have a complete picture of the info
> shared between *Former Manager* and *New Manager*. The goal is to make
> sure we’re transparent in the handoff of your career, how you want to
> grow, and the best ways *New Manager* can support you.
> 
> This stuff can naturally be very awkward for all involved :) This is
> okay (and normal\!) - it’s awkwardness in service of clarity and fully
> supporting *Direct Report*’s career path, which can otherwise be
> muddled in manager changes.

I brought Etsy’s internal Charter of Mindful Communication over to
Kickstarter Engineering when I joined. I usually reference that in the
agenda, too, including reminders that each person in the meeting is
responsible to do the following:

  - Consider power dynamics. They are pervasive and exist even if – and
    where – we wish they didn’t.
  - Meet transparency with responsibility.
  - Prepare to be surprised.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**The 1:1:1**



<div class="panelContent">

One of the managers should start by **restating the goals** (transparent
handoff of career and manager info, an opportunity for the direct report
to clarify and even disagree with what’s said, and reduced changes to
the direct report’s career momentum).

After the restating of goals, the former manager should **share their
context** directly to the new manager. Again, this is awkward, as the
direct report is sitting right there, listening\! But as much as
possible, be transparent and honest (while mindful) as you share your
context, history, feedback, goals, etc.

The new manager should feel free to **ask questions** as it happens
naturally. Get clarification, aim for that shared understanding of
history, goals, etc.

If the direct report is quiet, the new manager should be routinely
asking them - how do you feel so far about what’s been said? **Does this
description match your experience?** Are we missing something on that
topic? Anything we should clarify? Anything you disagree with?

I’ve seen this be a super boring meeting where everything is clear and
agreed with. I’ve seen this get sticky and uncomfortable when a direct
report has an opposing viewpoint or different recollection. As
necessary, acknowledge out loud that it’s okay if this is awkward. If it
gets to a point where the dialog isn’t productive anymore, the new
manager should talk with the direct report separately and privately
about their experience. It’s totally natural that the former manager and
direct report have different perceptions of the same events or feedback
- we’re humans, which means this stuff is messy. Where it helps, restate
those original meeting goals.

More often than not, even when things get uncomfortable, it’s still a
really productive use of everyone’s time, and starts the new reporting
relationship off on a much healthier foot. It’ll be quicker for the new
manager and direct report to form a trusting relationship. And thanks to
the shared understanding of events that the new manager had no prior
firsthand experience with, *hopefully* nothing is changed about the
timeline for the direct report’s future promotion process, trajectory
towards goals, etc.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**The follow-up**



<div class="panelContent">

If the former manager was surprised that at the direct report’s
perception of the same events, this is a great reminder to be
continually checking in with one’s reports, gathering *their* feedback,
and reducing surprise wherever possible.

If the direct report was surprised at how things were described by their
former manager, this is *also* a nice reminder to routinely check in on
how your manager is thinking and feeling about things, especially
feedback they have for you. While ideally managers are giving routine
feedback, your career path is truly your own responsibility; do the work
to make sure you have a shared understanding with your manager about
your path forward.

And lastly, where possible, make sure documentation of all this context
(like previous reviews, lists of goals, etc.) are shared between folks
and easily surfaced. I have an Evernote file with each person’s answers
to those first 1:1 questions, which makes it super easy to share in the
future with a new manager.

Do you Scare Your Employees



<div id="expander-content-1724722302" class="expand-content">

How your employees feel about your style impacts business performance.
According to a
2018 [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1548051817709007?journalCode=jlob&),
managing employees with pressure tactics resulted in more than a 90%
increase in the predicted turnover of employees, while using more
inspirational tactics was related to roughly a 68% *decrease* in likely
turnover. And [research
shows](https://www.mbs.ac.uk/news/toxic-bosses--how-destructive-personality-traits-can-infect-a-workforce/) that
employees of toxic bosses engage in more counterproductive work
behaviors as a form of retaliation against their colleagues and leaders.

As an executive coach, I work with clients who are dealing with
intimidating bosses as well as those who exhibit negative tendencies
themselves. Here are five ways to ensure that your employees don’t
experience any unnecessary trepidation around you.

## Assume they are afraid of you, and then reflect and observe.

Given the power differential, asking employees if you make them anxious
probably won’t yield the truth. Think about how you behave in various
situations. Do you treat your employees with the courtesy you give to
customers, or do you take them for granted? Do you go overboard with
your tone and mannerisms when expressing dissatisfaction? In addition to
looking at your behavior, observe your employees’. Do people withdraw or
fail to make eye contact when around you? Do employees [seem reluctant
to present an opposing point of
view?](https://hbr.org/2016/01/can-your-employees-really-speak-freely)

## Ask open-ended questions about team culture

Gather broader insight about how your employees see your team and feel
about work. Ask them to describe a time in the last six to 12 months
when they felt unable to express their ideas and a time when they felt
free to do so. By asking “when” instead of “if” they felt a certain way,
you will prompt them to scan their memories for real examples instead of
simply saying no and forgoing the opportunity to share.

## Check whether you are projecting your fears onto others

Many leaders cope with their [fear of
failure](https://hbr.org/2018/12/how-to-overcome-your-fear-of-failure) by
pushing themselves and others harder, instilling the same fear in their
teams. Consider a VP whom I coached in a global Fortune 100 company,
whose staff walked on eggshells around him. An insatiable corrector of
his employees’ work, he saw himself as a perfectionist and was proud of
it. Recently promoted, he was experiencing the classic growing pains of
becoming a more senior executive. Instead of reallocating his time to
strategic concerns and empowering his team to handle tactical needs, he
micromanaged, and readily admitted that he was projecting onto the group
his worries about being able to personally deliver.

## Shift your ratio of connection and correction

Executives who *connect *rather than *correct* remove fear in the
workplace, replacing it with meaningful dialogue that helps to co-create
a shared definition of success. It doesn’t take a long time to shift
away from the correction habit. Over the span of a month, a CEO whom I
coached wrote three words in a journal every time he had the urge to
correct a team member: “Connect with them.” He would then suspend his
judgment and invite them to discuss a path forward. He would say, “I
know I usually correct you before getting your perspective first, and I
want to change that because I value your contribution. Let me also share
why correcting this is important to me, so we’re on the same page and
can decide a plan together.”

## Show vulnerability

Leaders who create safe cultures welcome dissent from subordinates and
concede power every once in a while in the service of increasing the
team’s commitment. But this takes vulnerability. Consider whether you
have ever, without a hint of frustration or defensiveness, allowed your
employees to prove you wrong. If you haven’t, consider doing so, and
don’t worry too much about whether it will make you look weak.
Instead, remember the pratfall effect: Generally competent people are
deemed to be more appealing when they make a mistake. And [research
shows](https://hbr.org/2013/05/im-the-boss-why-should-i-care) that
likability is a requisite for being seen as a successful leader.

  

Some bosses believe that being aggressive is the only way to get
results, and there are times when that approach works. But when they
manage with no awareness of employees’ experience, leaders stand to lose
their key talent and invite more dysfunction into the workplace, which
limits productivity. By better understanding how your people view your
leadership style, you can make sure your behavior doesn’t cross the line
between pushing them hard and pushing them away.

Your team does not like you

You've got a (bad) gut feeling



<div id="expander-content-823852415" class="expand-content">

"The very first sign that things are going awry in your relationships
with employees is a general gnawing feeling that you can't put your
finger on," Taylor says. "No manager can be liked by everyone, but there
are far too many bosses who are not respected by enough of their staff."
If you've got that gut feeling something is off, be aware and start
looking for other signs.





<div id="expander-778982929" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-778982929" class="expand-control">

They can't maintain eye contact with you (but can with everyone else).



<div id="expander-content-778982929" class="expand-content">

It's difficult for an employee who is angry to look you straight in the
eye, says Taylor. "They're afraid that you may be able to detect
hostility, so the path of least resistance is for them to look away or
avoid being around you wherever possible."





<div id="expander-2091724286" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-2091724286" class="expand-control">

They avoid you like the proverbial plague.



<div id="expander-content-2091724286" class="expand-content">

If you notice they take the stairs every time you're waiting for the
elevator, or they manage their schedules in such a way that they rarely
overlap with your primary work hours, that's a good sign they're
avoiding you. And employees typically only avoid people who intimidate
them or who they don't like





<div id="expander-683398744" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-683398744" class="expand-control">

They call in sick a lot, especially due to stress-related reasons



<div id="expander-content-683398744" class="expand-content">

Having an employee who goes on "stress leave" or constantly calls in
sick could be a sign that they are not comfortable working under your
direction, Kerr explains.

"Your employee(s) may not be showing up at work as often, may come to
work late, leave early, or are just seemingly never at their desks,
because of long, needed breaks," adds Taylor. "Leaving the scene can
take many forms — and it's a common way that your staff copes with
stress. A bad boss-employee relationship is a leading cause of stress
and illness,"





<div id="expander-765729325" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-765729325" class="expand-control">

They don't smile around you



<div id="expander-content-765729325" class="expand-content">

We're not talking about the occasional bad day or mood swing. If one or
more of your employees seem to look *miserable* every time they're
around you — but you've seen them smiling while talking to others in the
office — something isn't right.

"It's difficult for any employee to put on a happy face when they're
talking to someone they \[dislike\],"





<div id="expander-1670832842" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1670832842" class="expand-control">

They stop laughing and bantering the moment you walk into the room



<div id="expander-content-1670832842" class="expand-content">

Not smiling when they're around you is one thing — but clamming up when
you step into the office kitchen or conference room is a pretty strong
sign that your employees *really *don't like you and don't consider you
part of their inner circle





<div id="expander-105113480" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-105113480" class="expand-control">

They seem less passionate about their work than they used to be



<div id="expander-content-105113480" class="expand-content">

You may not be the reason for this (so many things affect one's level of
motivation or enthusiasm at work) — but you *could* be. "If their level
of enthusiasm has waned, and you're not seeing your staff jump at the
opportunity to help out on new or existing projects anymore, it may be a
sign you're disliked





<div id="expander-1595724573" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1595724573" class="expand-control">

They never invite you to social events



<div id="expander-content-1595724573" class="expand-content">

If your employees don't include you in any after-work social events or
happy hours, it very well may be because they don't want to spend any
more time with you than they absolutely have to.





<div id="expander-242553090" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-242553090" class="expand-control">

They communicate with you via email, when they talk to others in person



<div id="expander-content-242553090" class="expand-content">

"Your unhappy employees may change the way they communicate with you,
such as through email, voicemail, or IM, instead of in-person
communications," Taylor explains. "You may detect less personal contact,
so that there is less of an opportunity for potential confrontation."





<div id="expander-1943756519" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1943756519" class="expand-control">

They're short with you



<div id="expander-content-1943756519" class="expand-content">

If you ask, "How's it going?" and they always respond with "Ok" or
"Fine" — or if their emails to always get straight to the point, and
never begin with a friendly "Hello" or "Good afternoon," this may be a
sign they're not a huge fan of you.

"If your employees are beginning to sound like your moody teenager, then
that's a pretty big red flag,"





<div id="expander-847731361" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-847731361" class="expand-control">

They give off negative body language



<div id="expander-content-847731361" class="expand-content">

Whether it's a subtle eye roll or constantly assuming a closed-off
position with arms folded across their chest, your employees' body
language will often reveal their true feelings towards you

**"**Many employees don't have the luxury of their own office these
days, but if they do, and their door appears closed more often than not,
they may be commiserating with friends, family, or even other
colleagues,"

"They may be seeking advice, or worse, checking out greener pastures."





<div id="expander-893393580" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-893393580" class="expand-control">

They constantly disagree with you



<div id="expander-content-893393580" class="expand-content">

"Not all employees shy away from confronting the personality clashes as
they pertain to business, thankfully," says Taylor. "You may find that
your staff seems increasingly more difficult and disagreeable, whereas
before you were never questioned. This may be because before, they
tolerated a more dictatorial management style — but now they've realized
that they have nothing to lose by challenging you, in the hopes that
they will see changes."





<div id="expander-1775514126" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1775514126" class="expand-control">

They resign for no good reason



<div id="expander-content-1775514126" class="expand-content">

Scads of surveys indicate that "the boss" still ranks as a top reason
for employees leaving a job. If they don't provide a good excuse or
reason for leaving, there's a good chance it's you.

Summary of "21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership"



<div id="expander-content-1350913789" class="expand-content">

Author [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

## Law 1 - The Law of the Lid

Maxwell defines the **Law of the Lid** by saying "*leadership ability is
the lid that determines a person’s level of effectiveness. The lower an
individual’s ability to lead, the lower the lid on his potential.*" This
idea is troubling for some people because it means that no matter how
much you desire to be a 10 on the scale of leadership, there is a cap to
your abilities based on a number of factors. Some of these factors are
your people skills, planning abilities, vision, dedication to success,
and your past results.

The truth is, there are very few 10’s in the world; however, when you
leverage the law of the lid and assess your own leadership, then you
will have a straightforward view of who your followers are, where they
might land on the leadership scale, and areas in which you can grow in
to raise your leadership lid. The reality is that if you are a 7 on the
leadership scale, in most cases you won’t be able to lead someone who is
an 8, 9, or 10. Yet your skills can still offer invaluable leadership to
people who are at a level of a 5 or 6.

The good news is, the law of the lid has room for flexibility. It is
unwise to think that where you are today as a leader is as good as you
will ever be. Every leader can grow, but it takes a dedication to do so
and a willingness to work for it.

## Law 2 - The Law of Influence

Maxwell’s definition for the **Law of Influence** is that “*the true
measure of leadership is influence nothing more, nothing less.*” This,
of course, is one of John Maxwell’s most famous quotes heard around the
world (and world-wide web). It’s a great quote, but how often do you
take time to ask yourself the big question: who are you influencing?

Maybe a bigger question for us to ask is, what type of influence are we
offering those who follow us? Insecure leaders often influence people in
such a way that it keeps others down in order to protect their own
position of leadership in the group. This is a shame. The best leaders
realize that leadership is always about raising people up to their
highest potential, even if it means they one day become better leaders
than themselves.

Leadership is not determined by having a title. It doesn’t matter if you
are CEO, Pastor, Director, Manager, or Man of the House, you are not a
leader if people do not follow your lead. Maxwell says, “*True
leadership cannot be awarded, appointed, or assigned. It comes only from
influence, and that cannot be mandated. It must be earned.*” He goes on
to say, “*When it comes to identifying a real leader… don’t listen to
the claims of the person professing to be the leader. Don’t examine his
credentials. Don’t check his title. Check his influence. The proof of
leadership is found in the followers.*” He ends the chapter with a
famous leadership proverb, “*He who thinks he leads, but has no
followers, is only taking a walk.*"

## Law 3 - The Law of Process

The subtitle for this chapter is, “*Leadership Develops Daily, Not in a
Day.*” This means that you can tell where a person will end up by
watching their daily habits and priorities. It means that as a leader,
we must have a personal plan for growth. Maxwell writes, “*What can you
see when you look at a person’s daily agenda? Priorities, passion,
abilities, relationships, attitude, personal disciplines, vision, and
influence*” All of those things contribute to the destination you will
arrive at later on in your journey of life. Therefore, it doesn’t matter
at all where you hope to end up, if you do not first determine which
road you ought to be traveling on to get there.

The law of process also comes into play as we set out to lead others.
Maxwell says, “*Just as you need a growth plan to improve, so do those
who work for you.*” This means that as we lead others, we have to set
them on a course for success as well.

## Law 4 - The Law of Navigation

This law follows closely after the law of process. Once you have
determined the process to get where you are going personally, the next
step is being able to navigate your business or organization through the
challenges and obstacles to reach to success. Maxwell quotes Jack Welch,
former CEO of General Electric, as saying, “*A good leader remains
focused… Controlling your direction is better than being controlled by
it.*”

The **Law of Navigation** is where leadership differentiates itself from
other voices wanting to be heard. Leaders look back at past experiences,
prior successes, and hurtful failures. They learn from those things and
then look ahead to see where conflict and challenge may arise. With all
of these in mind, leaders will preemptively respond according to those
challenges as they move forward toward the goal. This is more than
vision-casting. This is determining what it will take to fulfill the
vision. Maxwell says it this way: “*Anyone can steer the ship, but it
takes a leader to chart the course.*"

## Law 5 - The Law of Addition

The **Law of Addition** law simply says, “*Leaders add value by serving
others.*” Maxwell says that we add value to others when we truly value
them and intentionally make ourselves valuable to them. He says, “*90
percent of all people who add value to others do so intentionally.*” The
most helpful way we do this is to actually get to know the people we are
leading, find out their priorities, goals, hopes, and dreams, and then
figure out what we can do to assist them in getting where they need to
go. Maxwell says, “*Inexperienced leaders are quick to lead before
knowing anything about the people they intend to lead. But mature
leaders listen, learn, and then lead.*”

## Law 6 - The Law of Solid Ground

Maxwell defines **The Law of Solid Ground** by saying: “*trust is the
foundation of leadership*” This is perhaps the greatest challenge
leaders face in the 21st century, especially those of us expressly
leading as Christians with the Kingdom of God in mind. Too many people
are disillusioned with leaders because it has been too-often abused by
self-serving leaders. This is especially true of politicians and
television preachers. Trust, then, is the most important element in
leadership. If you do not have trust, you have nothing to offer.

Maxwell says that we build trust “*by consistently exemplifying
competence, connection, and character,*” and that we must “*treat trust
as our most precious asset.*” He later writes, “*How do leaders earn
respect? By making sound decisions, by admitting their mistakes, and by
putting what’s best for their followers and the organization ahead of
their personal agendas.*” This is because, “*no leader can break trust
with his people and expect to keep influencing them,*” and, as we
already know, “*leadership is influence, nothing more.*"

## Law 7 - The Law of Respect

Similar to the high necessity of trust, is the necessity of respect. The
**Law of Respect** reminds us that “people naturally follow leaders
stronger than themselves.” Maxwell says, “One of the greatest potential
pitfalls for natural leaders is relying on talent alone… good leaders
rely on respect. They understand that all leadership is voluntary.” He
says that “when people respect you as a person, they admire you. When
they respect you as a friend, they love you. When they respect you as a
leader, they follow you.” The opposite is true as well. As soon as
people lose respect for you, your influence over them will disappear.

## Law 8 - The Law of Intuition

Maxwell says that “*every person possesses intuition*” and “*people are
intuitive in their area of strength.*” Therefore this law says that
using intuition, “*Leaders evaluate everything with a leadership bias.*”
The **Law of Intuition** is based on facts and instinct as well as other
ever-changing factors such as “*employee morale, organizational
momentum, and relational dynamics.*” Out of all of the leadership skills
one can develop over time, intuition may be the hardest because it
relies on more than just leadership experience. It has a lot to do with
your natural aptitude for seeing all of these factors at once and
naturally discerning possible actions and probable outcomes. Maxwell
says of intuitive leaders, “*they ‘tune in’ to leadership dynamics. Many
leaders describe this as an ability to ‘smell’ things in their
organization. They can sense people’s attitudes. They are able to detect
the chemistry of a team… They don’t need to sift through stats, read
reports, or examine a balance sheet. They know the situation before they
have all the facts. That is the result of their leadership intuition.*”
This ability is one that is either natural or must be nurtured, and for
many people who refuse to grow as a leader, it means they will never
have this ability. Developing this intuition through experience and
growth is invaluable because, as Maxwell says, “*whenever leaders face a
problem, they automatically measure it — and begin solving it — using
the Law of Intuition.*"

## Law 9 - The Law of Magnetism

The **Law of Magnetism** states, “*Who you are is who you attract,*” or
more simply, you will attract people like yourself. This can be a good
thing in many cases, but is also a call to action to know your
weaknesses and seek to grow out of them. Maxwell says, “*Leaders help to
shape the culture of their organizations based on who they are and what
they do,*” and “*not only do people attract others with similar
attitudes, but their attitudes tend to become alike.*”

I have heard it said before that in five years, the things you won’t
like about your organization is what you don’t like about yourself
today. Your personality, character traits, quirks, and mannerisms will
both attract people like yourself to your organization as well as rub
off on the existing people within. According to Maxwell, “*Like attracts
like. That may seem pretty obvious. Yet I’ve met many leaders who expect
highly talented people to follow them, even though they neither possess
nor express value for those people’s giftedness.*” Therefore, “*if you
want to grow an organization, grow the leader*” and “*if you want to
attract better people, become the kind of person you desire to
attract.*” Then, once you are attracting the people you want to have
following you, then its time to take yourself and those people to the
next level together.

## Law 10 - The Law of Connection

Maxwell summarizes **The Law of Connection** by saying, “*leaders touch
a heart before they ask for a hand.*” Another way to say this is that
people will not follow you until they are emotionally bought into the
vision you are casting. There is also some tie in here with the famous
quote, “*people don’t care how much you know, until they know how much
you care.*” Maxwell says, “*You develop credibility with people when you
connect with them and show that you genuinely care and want to help
them.*”

To truly connect with people you have to value them, learn about them,
and then adapt to who they are. Do not expect people to change
themselves in order to follow you. You must change yourself in order to
invite them in. Even the Apostle Paul understood this principle when, in
his evangelistic efforts, he declared, “*For though I am free from all,
I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. To
the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law
I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law)
that I might win those under the law. To those outside the law I became
as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the
law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. To the weak I
became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all
people, that by all means I might save some*” (1 Corinthians 9:19-22).

The law of connection means that we understand people’s self-identity,
meet them where they are, and build connection with them first before we
try to get them to follow us or buy into the vision of where we want to
go.

## Law 11 - The Law of the Inner Circle

**The Law of the Inner Circle** states that “*a leader’s potential is
determined by those closest to him.*” This is similar in effect to the
law of magnetism, which says your followers will look like you, except
that this says you will begin to look like those with whom you surround
yourself with. When I was in high school, the guidance counselor would
say, “*you show me your friends, and I’ll show you your future.*” I
hated that quote at the time since I wanted to be in control of my own
destiny, yet because this law is universal, time has proven that
statement true every time.

To leverage the law of the inner circle then, we must surround ourselves
continually with people we admire and respect; people we want to become
like as we grow. Unfortunately this is counter intuitive to the
leadership style of most. Insecure leaders feel threatened when they are
not the smartest and most talented people in the room, so they surround
themselves with people weaker than themselves. This, however, means that
their potential for growth themselves is stunted by the capacity of
those they keep near.

Maxwell says in order to leverage the law of the inner circle and “*to
increase your capacity and maximize your potential as a leader, your
first step is always to become the best leader you can. The next is to
surround yourself with the best leaders you can find.*”

## Law 12 - The Law of Empowerment

Following closely behind the law of the inner circle is the **Law of
Empowerment**. This law states that “*only secure leaders give power to
others.*” This means that secure leaders spend their time “*identifying
leaders; building them up; giving them resources, authority, and
responsibility; and then turning them loose to achieve…*” Insecure
leaders, on the other hand, spend their time suspicious of those around
them, and do everything they can to undermine people’s potential and
growth.

Former U.S. President, Theodore Roosevelt said, “*The best executive is
the one who has sense enough to pick good men to do what he wants done,
and the self-restraint enough to keep from meddling with them while they
do it.*” Maxwell says this is because, “*to keep others down, you have
to go down with them. And when you do that, you lose any power to lift
others up.*”

Maxwell says, “*The truth is that empowerment is powerful-not only for
the person being developed but also for the mentor. Enlarging others
makes you larger.*” Therefore, to take advantage of this law in our
lives, we must come to understand that as we develop the leaders around
us we not only inadvertently raise our own value as a leader, but our
organizations are benefited in the process as well.

## Law 13 - The Law of the Picture

The **Law of the Picture** says that “*people do what people see.*” This
may be one of the highest laws in understanding that everything rises
and falls on leadership. Character matters. Maxwell says, “*When the
leaders show the way with the right actions, their followers copy them
and succeed.*” Corrupt leaders will turn every leader around them into
corrupt leaders because their own lives demonstrate that it is good and
acceptable.

From the Christian perspective as leaders, we must understand that
integrity must come first in everything we do, because other people are
watching us, and they will follow our example. One scripture that comes
to mind here is the command in Hebrews 13:7, “*Remember your leaders,
those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their
way of life, and imitate their faith.*”

## Law 14 - The Law of Buy-In

The **Law of Buy-In** says, “*People buy into the leader, then the
vision.*” Maxwell writes, “*Many people who approach the area of vision
in leadership have it all backward. They believe that if the cause is
good enough, people will automatically buy into it and follow. But
that’s not how leadership really works. People don’t at first follow
worthy causes. They follow worthy leaders who promote causes they can
believe in.*” If we roll this back to the law of the picture, this means
that if your credibility as a leader is questionable at best, you are
not going to have people willing to follow the vision you are casting
because they doubt you can get them there.

One of the biggest leadership lessons I took away from my own
experiences in 2014 was that leadership is inevitably connected to the
opportunities they present. Sometimes saying “no” to a bad leader means
saying “no” to a good opportunity, and sometimes saying “no” to a bad
opportunity means saying “no” to a good leader. This was my personal
realization of the law of buy-in. Maxwell says it this way, “*You cannot
separate leaders from the causes they promote. It cannot be done, no
matter how hard you try. It’s not an either/or proposition. The two
always go together.*”

As a leader, you cannot just promote your vision and the good work you
are doing through websites and social media, and expect that people will
jump on board to volunteer or give money. If they do not trust you, it
does not matter what opportunity you put in front of them. From my own
observation in global ministry, I think this may be the biggest issue
those of us in the non-profit and humanitarian world need to learn.

## Law 15 - The Law of Victory

The **Law of Victory** states that leaders find a way for the team to
win. Maxwell writes, “*Every leadership station is different. Every
crisis has its own challenges. But I think that victorious leaders have
one thing in common: they share an unwillingness to accept defeat. The
alternative to winning is totally unacceptable to them. As a result,
they figure out what must be done to achieve victory.*”

Though not mentioned in the book, I think back to the 2009 movie (based
on the 1960’s TV show) Star Trek, and the always-inspiring Captain James
T. Kirk. In every situation Kirk refuses to accept defeat and always
finds a way to accomplish the mission at hand. One of the story lines to
build this characteristic in Kirk was featured during his time at Star
fleet Academy when he took a virtual reality test which presented him
with a “no-win” scenario. In order to beat the test scenario, Kirk
reprogrammed the simulation, and as he faced expulsion for cheating, he
referred to the test itself as a cheat since there was no way to
successfully complete the challenge. His mindset would not allow him to
even accept the premise of a “no-win” scenario.

This is the way a leader thinks who embraces the law of victory. They
take responsibility, get creative, and throw all of their experience and
passion into reaching success. There is a no-quit attitude, and failure
is not an option. These leaders are always inspiring to those behind
them, even when the challenge gets difficult.

Maxwell quotes Lou Holtz, former Notre Dame head football coach, as
saying, “*You’ve got to have great athletes to win, I don’t care who the
coach is. You can’t win without good athletes, but you can lose with
them. This is where coaching makes the difference.*” Good leaders take
responsibility for the success of the team and do what it takes to lead
the way to victory

## Law 16 - The Law of the Big Mo

The **Law of the Big Mo** states that “*momentum is a leader’s best
friend.*” Maxwell says this is “*because many times (momentum) is the
only thing that makes the difference between losing and winning. When
you have no momentum, even the simplest tasks seem impossible… On the
other hand, when you have momentum on your side, the future looks
bright, obstacles appear small, and troubles seem inconsequential.*”

This law comes into place when an organization is starting out.
Everything is a challenge, and it seems to take forever to get anything
done. However, just like a train slowly gaining speed, once that same
organization gets moving, there is no stopping it. In physics this
phenomenon is referred to as the law of inertia, which states in part
that “an object in motion continues in motion with the same speed and in
the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.”

This truth is the same when it comes to leadership. An organization with
forward momentum is hard to slow down. The challenge is in getting that
momentum built up in the first place (and making sure the momentum is in
the direction you want the organization to go). Maxwell says, “*Creating
momentum requires someone who has vision, can assemble a good team, and
motivates others. If the leader is looking for someone to motivate him,
then the organization is in trouble.*"

## Law 17 - The Law of Priories

For almost two years now, the background image on my computer desktop
has challenged me with the question, “*Are you being productive, or just
being busy?*” This is at the heart of the **Law of Priorities**, which
says, “*leaders understand that activity is not necessarily about
accomplishment.*”

Maxwell says, “*When we are busy, we naturally believe that we are
achieving. But business does not equal productivity. Activity is not
necessarily accomplishment.*” This means prioritizing, which “*requires
leaders to continually think ahead, to know what’s important, to see how
everything relates to the overall vision.*” Sometimes what is highest on
that priority list is not comfortable or easy.Key to leveraging the law
of priorities is called the Pareto Principle or more commonly the 80/20
principle. Maxwell says that if we will spend most of our time working
on the things in the top 20% of importance, it will give us 80% of the
return we are looking for. This means things like giving 80% of your
time to your top 20% of employees.

The other factors Maxwell discusses in setting your priority list are
his three R’s: Requirement, Return, and Reward. These three things make
us ask: “*what must I do that nobody can or should do for me?*” Is there
anyone I can delegate this task to capable of getting the same return as
I can? And what tasks will lead to the most satisfaction? “*Life is too
short to not do some things you love.*” When we properly prioritize how
we spend our time, it will always set us on course for success. When we
don’t prioritize our time, we will often look back wondering where it
all went.

## Law 18 - The Law of Sacrifice

The **Law of Sacrifice** gives us a glimpse into the heart of a leader:
“*a leader must give up to go up.*” Maxwell says, “*There is a common
misconception among people who aren’t leaders that leadership is all
about the position, perks, and power that come from rising in an
organization… The life of a leader can look glamorous to people on the
outside. But the reality is that leadership requires sacrifice.*”

I have a friend who has invested thousands of hours of his time and
thousands of dollars to receive leadership training from the best
teachers our generation has to offer. He owns and runs a successful
branch of the company for which he works, he has a healthy bank account,
and is capable of enjoying many comforts that life has to offer. What
impresses me the most about this friend, though, is not his success in
the business world, but his willingness to put all of his success on the
line to take his leadership to the next level and share with others. He
has recently taken on a regional leadership position with his company
that gives him the ability to take personal time to travel around the
region without pay to meet with others in the company and help them
develop their own branch of the business. He has also launched a
community leadership networking group which is costing him personal time
and money to develop leaders in our city for which he will receive
little to no return. While many people see a white-collar business man
and think, “that must be nice to not have to work so hard,” what I see
in my friend is someone who works twice as hard as most to give other
people a leg up in life and business.

Maxwell says, “*There is no success without sacrifice. Every person who
has achieved any success in life has made sacrifices to do so.*” He
adds, “*the heart of leadership is putting others ahead of yourself.
It’s doing what is best for the team.*” If you are pursuing leadership
for personal gain or recognition, then you are not, in reality, a
quality leader.

## Law 19 - The Law of Timing

For natural leaders, many of the principles discussed up to this point
can be fairly easy to live by. Even those who may not be born-leaders,
but who have invested time and effort to grow in this area,may have a
lot of success with them. Yet, when we come to the **Law of Timing**, I
believe this is where many leaders can begin to struggle. This law
teaches us that “*when to lead is as important as what to do and where
to go.*”

Maxwell gives a few summary statements. He says, “*the wrong action at
the wrong time leads to disaster.*” “*The right action at the wrong time
brings resistance.*” “*The wrong action at the right time is a
mistake.*” However, “*the right action at the right time results in
success.*” As we develop our leadership abilities, we have to go beyond
simply knowing how to lead. We must also learn to discern when it is the
right time to do so.

## Law 20 - The Law of Explosive Growth

At this stage in the book, Maxwell takes a turn from simply sharing laws
vital to good leadership, and begins to teach how to take our leadership
higher. The **Law of Explosive Growth** says, “*To add growth, lead
followers,*” but, “*to multiply, lead leaders.*” Maxwell further
explains this distinction by saying, “*if you develop yourself, you can
experience personal success. If you develop a team, your organization
can experience growth. (But) if you develop leaders, your organization
can achieve explosive growth.*” He adds, “*You can grow by leading
followers. But if you want to maximize your leadership and help your
organization reach its potential, you need to develop leaders.*”

Some of the practical advice for leading leaders includes development of
the top 20% of people around you, rather than spending your time playing
catch up with the bottom 20%; focusing on strengths instead of
weaknesses, and treating everyone differently, rather than acting like
everyone must be treated the same. Determine what it takes to actually
invest quality time into others rather than just spending time together.

To live by the law of explosive growth is definitely harder and takes
more time and energy to do, yet when we do so the trickle-down ef

fect of those leaders investing in those under them, and so forth, will
lead to exponential multiplication. Maxwell summarizes this law by
saying, “*leaders who develop leaders experience an incredible
multiplication effect in their organizations that can be achieved in no
other way — not by increasing resources, reducing costs, increasing
profit margins, improving systems, implementing quality procedures, or
doing anything else.*”

## Law 21 - The Law of Legacy

The final law in the book is the Law of Legacy which states, “*A
leader’s lasting value is measured by succession.”* The chapter starts
by asking, “*What do you want people to say at your funeral? That may
seem like an odd question, but it may be the most important thing you
can ask yourself as a leader.*”

A couple of years ago, I went through a practice in setting what Andy
Stanley calls “*Be-goals,*” which are character qualities a person wants
to be known for in life. Maybe goals are things like, God seeking, holy
(set apart for God/fighting sin and temptation), and humble. In walking
through this practice, determining these be-goals, which are the things
I want said of me at my funeral, is in effect determining what success
in life looks like for myself. However, this is an activity most people
will never engage in. Maxwell says, “*most people simply accept their
lives — they don’t lead them.*” To be sure, my favorite statement made
in this chapter, if not the entire book is, “*someday people will
summarize your life in a single sentence. My advice: pick it now\!*”

One day we will all be gone, and what remains of us will be the examples
we set with our lives and the people we leave behind empowered to
continue on. Maxwell summarizes the life of a leader by saying that
“*achievement comes when they do big things by themselves. Success
comes when they empower followers to do big things for them.
Significance comes when they develop leaders to do great things with
them. Legacy comes when they put leaders in position to do great things
without them.*” He ends the chapter with the thought, “*our abilities as
leaders will not be measured by the buildings we built, the institutions
we established, or what our team accomplished during our tenure. You and
I will be judged by how well the people we invested in carried on after
we are gone.*” This is the greatest challenge a lifelong pursuit of
leadership will face, but it is also the only thing that will matter in
the end.

Handling Conflicts

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Communication**



<div class="panelContent">

If you reflect back upon conflicts you have encountered over the years,
you’ll quickly recognize many of them resulted from a lack of
information, poor information, no information, or misinformation. Let’s
assume for a moment that you were lucky enough to have received good
information, but didn’t know what to do with it…That is still a
communication problem, which in turn can lead to conflict. Clear,
concise, accurate, and timely communication of information will help to
ease both the number and severity of conflicts.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Emotions**



<div class="panelContent">

Another common mistake made in workplace communications which leads to
conflict is letting emotions drive decisions. I have witnessed otherwise
savvy executives place the need for emotional superiority ahead of
achieving their mission (not that they always understood this at the
time). Case in point - have you ever witnessed an employee throw a fit
of rage and draw the regrettable *line in the sand* in the heat of the
moment? If you have, what you really watched was a person indulging
their emotions rather than protecting their future.

The very bane of human existence, which is in fact human nature itself,
will always create gaps in thinking & philosophy,  and no matter how
much we all wish it wasn’t so…it is. So the question then becomes how to
effectively deal with conflict when it arises. It is essential for
organizational health and performance that conflict be accepted and
addressed through effective conflict resolution processes. While having
a conflict resolution structure is important, effective utilization of
conflict resolution processes is ultimately dependant upon the ability
of all parties to understand the benefits of conflict resolution, and
perhaps more importantly, their desire to resolve the matter. The
following tips will help to more effective handle conflicts in the
workplace:

<div id="expander-2134543670" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-2134543670" class="expand-control">

Define Acceptable Behavior



<div id="expander-content-2134543670" class="expand-content">

You know what they say about assuming…Just having a definition for what
constitutes acceptable behavior is a positive step in avoiding conflict.
Creating a framework for decisioning, using a published delegation of
authority statement, encouraging sound business practices in
collaboration, team building, leadership development, and talent
management will all help avoid conflicts. Having clearly defined job
descriptions so that people know what’s expected of them, and a well
articulated chain of command to allow for effective communication will
also help avoid conflicts. Clearly and publicly make it known what will
and won't be tolerated.





<div id="expander-41070379" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-41070379" class="expand-control">

Hit Conflict Head-on



<div id="expander-content-41070379" class="expand-content">

While you can’t always prevent conflicts, it has been my experience that
the secret to conflict resolution is in fact conflict prevention where
possible. By actually seeking out areas of potential conflict and
proactively intervening in a just and decisive fashion you will likely
prevent certain conflicts from ever arising. If a conflict does flair
up, you will likely minimize its severity by dealing with it quickly.
Time spent identifying and understanding natural tensions will help to
avoid unnecessary conflict.

If the conflict is not personal, don’t make it personal. Put your focus
on the problem and finding ways to solve that problem. You can’t change
the person, and you will likely continue working with them. Even if you
don’t want to be friends with the person, keep your focus on the problem
without making it a personal issue.

  - It’s easy to feel personally attacked for something, especially if
    it’s regarding your work. Do your best to not take things personally
    and keep everything within the lens of your work.

Understanding the WIIFM Factor

Understanding the other professionals WIIFM (What’s In It For Me)
position is critical. It is absolutely essential to understand other’s
motivations prior to weighing in. The way to avoid conflict is to help
those around you achieve their objectives. If you approach conflict from
the perspective of taking the action that will help others best achieve
their goals you will find few obstacles will stand in your way with
regard to resolving conflict.

The Importance Factor



<div id="expander-content-1944949726" class="expand-content">

Pick your battles and avoid conflict for the sake of conflict. However
if the issue is important enough to create a conflict then it is surely
important enough to resolve. If the issue, circumstance, or situation is
important enough, and there is enough at stake, people will do what is
necessary to open lines of communication and close positional and/or
philosophical gaps.





<div id="expander-1627877418" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1627877418" class="expand-control">

View Conflict as Opportunity



<div id="expander-content-1627877418" class="expand-content">

Hidden within virtually every conflict is the potential for a tremendous
teaching/learning opportunity. Where there is disagreement there is an
inherent potential for growth and development. If you’re a CEO who
doesn’t leverage conflict for team building and leadership development
purposes you’re missing a great opportunity. Divergent positions
addressed properly can stimulate innovation and learning in ways like
minds can't even imagine. Smart leaders look for the upside in all
differing opinions.









<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Embrace Conflict**



<div class="panelContent">

When conflict arises, don’t avoid it or pretend nothing has happened. As
time goes on, tension will build -- and the conflict only will get
worse. Deal with these uncomfortable issues as soon as possible, before
problems and bad feelings become embedded in everyday work.

If you notice a conflict between employees, encourage them to find a way
to work it out. If conflict develops between two teams, it's a good time
to improve [interdepartmental
communication](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/IT/Improve+Interdepartmental+Communication).
If you have a conflict with one of your employee, address it head on and
in private. 

Pretending that nothing is wrong isn’t the way to handle a conflict.
Begin by admitting there’s a problem that needs resolution. Acknowledge
the conflict and the roles you and the other person have played in
creating or sustaining the problem. Be honest with yourself about your
own role in the
situation.<sup>[\[2\]](https://m.wikihow.com/Resolve-a-Conflict-at-Work#_note-2)</sup>

  - Think about what factors are influencing the problem, such as
    scheduling, personality conflicts, feeling overworked, or disrupting
    some kind of perceived pecking
    order.<sup>[\[3\]](https://m.wikihow.com/Resolve-a-Conflict-at-Work#_note-3)</sup>
  - Look at not only your side, but the other side as well. Looking at
    both sides can help you understand the problem from both
    perspectives





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Talk Together**



<div class="panelContent">

Set up a time and place so you can talk for an extended span without
outside interruptions.

When you do meet, each person should have adequate time to say what he
or she believes the other party needs to hear. Don't let any individual
monopolize the conversation or control the topic. Each person should
talk about the disagreements and how he or she feels about the
situation.

Remember, this is not the time to attack or assign blame. Focus on the
problem, not your opinion of the other person’s character.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Listen Carefully**



<div class="panelContent">

It's essential to give your complete attention to the person who is
talking. Do not interrupt the other person.

Make sure you're getting the message he or she intends to send. Rephrase
and repeat back what you've heard to confirm understanding. You might
say something along the lines of, “Let me make sure I understand. You’re
upset about \_\_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_\_.”

Ask clarifying questions if needed. You can request that the other
person repeat a central idea or reword his or her frustrations in a way
that makes sense to you. 

Listening always should be about gaining understanding. Don’t let
yourself become reactionary to the other person's words.

Everything in the workplace involves communication, which is [critical
for efficiency and
effectiveness](https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/articles/2017-04-19/how-to-effectively-communicate-at-work).
However, not everyone naturally knows [how to listen
well](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2013/08/21/how-to-be-a-good-listener).

There are three levels of listening:

  - Internal listening: You're paying attention to your own inner voice,
    opinion, judgment and needs. For example, "That sounds hard" or "I'm
    hungry." This also includes thinking about what you want to say
    next.
  - Focused listening: You're focusing on the other person. This means
    not only listening to each word but also being aware of non-verbal
    communication and nuances.
  - Global listening: You're focusing on the energy and tone between you
    and your conversation partner and are aware of shifts in attitude.

To incorporate all of these levels of listening when managing conflict
in the workplace, first set the tone of the conversation. Let your
employee or co-worker know you want to talk about a touchy subject. Ask
for permission to discuss the issue. Then, be quiet and calm and go
through the problem slowly. Try asking questions rather than giving
advice. Notice how that changes the tone of the conversation.

Try to reduce your internal listening and develop your focused listening
skills. What is your co-worker not saying that you might miss? What has
she been saying that you've missed so far?

To improve your listening skills, have a close friend or family member
describe a problem with which he or she is struggling. Then, reflect
what he or she says and paraphrase without asking questions or giving
advice. This exercise will train you to be a better listener.

Make a commitment today to begin more active listening tomorrow. Also,
develop a plan to adjust the relationship agreements you have with a
co-worker if the current tone and boundaries aren't working.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Find Agreement**



<div class="panelContent">

Your conversation primarily will focus on the disagreements, but
resolution is possible only when you find points of agreement. You
should emerge from the experience with some positives instead of all
negatives.

Shed light on commonalities. Share examples or instances in which you
agree with the other person or can see another point of view. For
example, if you disagree on new sales tactics, you might share what you
liked about the other person’s idea or the motivation to work harder for
the team.

Looking for agreement demonstrates your willingness to seek out common
ground and build a relationship around those trust elements.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

**Provide Guidance**



<div class="panelContent">

If you're in a leadership position, there are times [you may need to
mediate work
conflict](http://smallbusiness.patriotsoftware.com/how-handle-conflict-at-work-communication/?utm_source=ENT45&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=GBL&utm_content=work_conflict).
Don’t take sides, ever. Realize you are there simply to help your
employees work out their problems.

You might need to guide the conversation. And if hurt feelings run high,
it's likely you'll need to redirect the topic so your employees return
to the real problem. If you're in a position to give advice on next
steps, highlight the positive aspects of the process and suggest related
topics or actions they can work through after the meeting.

**Be quick to forgive**



<div class="panelContent">

Every conflict needs a clear resolution that acknowledges hurt feelings
and finds a solution that begins to mend them. 

Apologize. Tell the other person you're truly sorry for any ill words or
actions -- and mean it. You'll also need to forgive the other person.
Agreeing solely for the sake of appearances can lead to grudges that
deepen over time, undoing any progress you've made together.

**Working at different paces**



<div class="panelContent">

Employees get tasks done at different speeds. Some people on
your [payroll](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/payroll/) work faster or
slower than others, which can cause conflict in a team. Some of your
workers might become frustrated with the varying paces. And, your
operations might not run as smoothly as possible when everyone is
working on a different timeline.

In business, there is such a thing as working too slow. You need to
produce and sell a certain number of products or services to increase
your [bottom line in
business](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/accounting/training/blog/what-is-bottom-line-business-management/).
Working at a slower rate could cost your business.

If employees work slower than an appropriate speed for your operations,
check to see what’s going on. The worker might just need an extra push
of motivation to pick up the pace. Or, the employee might be struggling
with a task and need your help.

An employee’s work might suffer because they think they need to work
lightning-fast. Explain to the employee that they can slow down and
focus on their tasks. Simple evaluations and conversations often solve
time-based issues.

To keep your team coordinated, set deadlines. That way, employees can be
team players and know when they are expected to complete work. Tasks
progress smoothly when workers can expect completion times.

**Different perspectives**



<div class="panelContent">

A diverse workforce offers many benefits to a small business. You gain
new ways of looking at your operations, customers, and problem solving.
Different backgrounds can also make the workday more interesting and
enjoyable. But, sometimes, conflicts can arise when employees don’t see
eye-to-eye.

Often, the issues stem from misunderstandings between employees. Each
worker has a different set of experiences that shapes their way of
thinking. As a leader in your business, you should help employees share
their perspectives with each other.

To promote [teamwork in the
workplace](https://smallbusiness.patriotsoftware.com/build-teamwork-in-workplace-tips/),
hold events that let employees get to know each other. For example, you
could host a holiday party or company picnic that aid in resolving team
conflict. Employees can see where others are coming from and understand
their co-workers’ choices.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Confusion about the brand**



<div class="panelContent">

Employees are great ambassadors for brand awareness. That is—when they
understand your company’s message. If a worker doesn’t get the
business’s brand, conflict in a team can happen. Your workforce needs
to be on the same page.

In
2012, [Gallup](http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/156197/employees-don-brand.aspx) asked
more than 3,000 randomly-selected workers if they agreed with the
statement, “I know what my company stands for and what makes our
brand(s) different from our competitors.” Twenty-four percent of the
participants responded that they disagreed.

The survey data above shows that many workers do not understand their
business’s brand. You need to convey your brand to employees so they can
function as a team with your company’s values.

Introduce your brand to employees during the [onboarding
process](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/payroll/training/blog/successfully-onboarding-new-employees/).
Include the brand message in your [employee
handbook](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/payroll/training/blog/what-is-the-benefit-of-an-employee-handbook/) and
training practices. Tell your business’s story to your team and get
employees involved.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Poor communication**



<div class="panelContent">

When it comes to a well-organized team, communication is key. Employees
need to know how to communicate with each other throughout the workday.
But, workers communicate in different ways.

To handle conflict in your team, turn your business into one that
welcomes communication. Managing conflict through communication means
making employees comfortable with sharing their ideas, feelings, and
thoughts. Your team will accomplish more when you work together and
foster connections.

Make it easy for employees to communicate with one another. Use team
collaboration tools so that employees can share information on the
internet. Provide cell phones for workers who work out of the office a
lot. Make employee work contact numbers and information available to
your team.

In some businesses and industries, you use technical terms. A new
employee might not be familiar with the terms your team uses to
communicate. It’s important for you to teach new hires the vocabulary
they need to know to complete tasks while onboarding.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Designing the Relationship**



<div class="panelContent">

Designing the relationship means creating an agreement with a co-worker
or employee to work together more effectively. This includes
establishing guidelines for communicating, accomplishing tasks and
having meetings. This also includes setting boundaries and determining
how to handle feedback and disagreements up front. [Talking about work
problems
openly](https://money.usnews.com/money/careers/company-culture/articles/2018-05-09/how-to-communicate-about-a-work-problem),
when things are calm and stable, will enable you to handle the difficult
times during the relationship.

To start, think about what makes you more willing to be open in a
professional relationship. These elements may include trust, respect or
mutual vulnerability (in a way that is reasonable for a professional
setting). Identify which of these three areas you struggle with and
develop relevant action items for the next month.

For example, a fellow co-worker or employee may feel more open if you
allow him the opportunity to express himself first regarding a project
or a task before you tell him your thoughts.

Next, create a checklist to work through with your co-worker, employee
or client that includes the following:

  - Objectives/tasks you need to achieve.
  - Roles you should each play in your relationship based on your
    strengths.
  - Challenges you have encountered previously and may encounter again,
    and how to handle them going forward.
  - Milestones you need to achieve for your project or task.
  - Ground rules for meetings and communication.

Finally, think about what the difficult employee or co-worker may need.
Generally, we need to feel trust, compassion, stability and hope in our
professional relationships. If you can pinpoint what quality the person
needs more of, this could help you prevent conflict at work.

These steps to design the relationship empower each person to take
responsibility and establish clear boundaries for positive
collaboration.

**Having Difficult Conversations When You Don’t Like Conflict**



<div class="panelContent">

Avoiding or delaying a difficult conversation can hurt your
relationships and create other negative outcomes. It may not feel
natural at first, especially if you dread discord, but you can learn to
dive into these tough talks by reframing your thoughts.

**Begin from a place of curiosity and respect, and stop worrying about
being liked. **Conflict avoiders are often worried about
their *likability*. While it’s natural to want to be liked, that’s not
always the most important thing. Lean into the conversation with an open
attitude and a genuine desire to learn. Start from a place of curiosity
and respect — for both yourself and the other person. Genuine respect
and vulnerability typically produce more of the same: mutual respect and
shared vulnerability. Even when the subject matter is difficult,
conversations can remain mutually supportive. Respect the other person’s
point of view, and expect them to respect yours.

**Focus on what you’re hearing, not what you’re saying. **People who shy
away from conflict often spend a huge amount of time mentally rewording
their thoughts. Although it might feel like useful preparation,
ruminating over what to say can hijack your mind for the entire workday
and sometimes even late into the night. And tough conversations rarely
go as planned anyway. So take the pressure off yourself. You don’t
actually need to talk that much during a difficult conversation.
Instead, focus on listening, reflecting, and observing. For example, if
a team member has missed another deadline, approach them by asking
neutral, supportive questions: “I see the project is behind schedule.
Tell me about the challenges you’re facing.” Then listen. Pause. Be
interested and proactive. Gather as much detail as possible. Ask
follow-up questions without blame.

Your genuine attention and neutrality encourage people to elaborate. For
every statement the other person makes, mirror back what they’ve said,
to validate that you understand them correctly.

The Elephant



<div id="expander-content-1947550845" class="expand-content">

Contributed by [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

  

Conflicts are fascinating. Now, this may be the organisational
psychologist in me talking, or the facilitator who senses them in the
groups I work with. But the other part of me dreads them. They scare me.
They make me anxious. And when I’m engaged in a conflict, my emotions
can get the better of me and make me do and say things I later regret.

One simple truth is that conflict is a natural part of working with
other people. Another is that our understanding of what ‘conflict’ is,
and when we are *in* it, is very limited — making it hard to effectively
deal with them.

> “Our understanding of what ‘conflict’ is, and when we are *in* it, is
> very limited — making it hard to effectively deal with them”

If you ask someone what “conflict” is, they usually explain it in terms
of a verbal dispute, raised voices, slamming doors and angry faces. But
most of our conflicts are far less visible. They may not be explicitly
expressed by those experiencing it, but they *do* influence the dynamics
of a group. And either the whole group is aware of this, or some are.
This is the proverbial ‘**Elephant In The Room**’. And when you don’t
see them, or don’t talk about them, it limits your ability as a team to
grow and learn from it. It also means that valuable energy is siphoned
into a conflict, instead of working together.

<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Types of Elephants**



<div class="panelContent">

When preparing for the workshop, we worked together to identify
‘archetypes’ of conflicts. The following absolutely non-complete,
non-authoritative list emerged:

  - A ‘**blame game**’ where one person or group feels they are
    unsuccessful because they are not getting what they need from
    others; while others, in turn, believe the person or group is not
    succeeding because of a lack of commitment or skill;
  - A group or person claims ‘**most of the air time**’ by going on and
    on about something they think or feel, while others remain silent or
    don’t share what they really think or feel;
  - Acts of ‘**sabotage**’, where one person or group actively or
    passively obstructs another person or group from achieving their
    goal, for example by not showing up for meetings or collaboration
    opportunities;
  - **‘Stepping on each other’s toes**’****due to a lack of clarity in
    how roles and responsibilities are distributed or because people are
    “not stepping up” according to some, and the resulting frustration
    from that;
  - There is the perception that a person or a group is ‘**nottaking
    responsibility**’ for a decision or is ‘**free-riding**’ on the
    success of others;
  - Because the system can’t see itself, everyone feels that they are
    ‘**contributing a bigger share**’ or working harder than the
    others;
  - People or groups feel that others are ‘**not fully honest**’ about
    their motives;
  - People or groups **‘bask in the light’** of someone they hold in
    high esteem, like a CEO or a manager, while others feel neglected,
    unheard or unseen by this person;
  - People or groups have different ideas on how to move forward, while
    also being frustrated by the inability of others to see their point
    of view (a **task conflict**);

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/8006/1*qD_ivVsR4pbdkPXQae3jeg.png)

One common theme is that many conflicts are essentially about our
relative status in a group. Specifically, when we feel our status is
lowered because others don’t value us or our contributions. When there
is disharmony in the social hierarchy, this causes strong emotional
responses — like frustration, anger, fear, shame, sadness or anxiety —
in those experiencing the disharmony. Its a good example of how our
primate brains evolved to value social hierarchies and our position in
them.

Another characteristic is that conflicts are often unilateral, in that
they are experienced by one party but not the others. This also depends
on our personal beliefs; what one person perceives as an attack on
personal status may be perceived by another as a ‘good and productive
debate’.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**What happens when there are Elephants …**



<div class="panelContent">

A lot of research has gone into exploring how groups can deal with
conflicts productively. In a large meta-analysis of 30 scientific
studies that explored the effects of task- and relational conflict in
teams, De Dreu & Weingart (2003) found that conflict has a strong
(negative) impact on team performance and work satisfaction. Another
finding was that the impact increases as the work becomes more complex.
The study concluded that the common belief that ‘conflict is good for
teams’ is not supported by data. The authors note that although a
*little* conflict can be productive, they tend to quickly escalate and
overload our ability to work together productively.





<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Surfacing The Elephant**



<div class="panelContent">

With most conflicts living below the surface, and having a significant
impact on our effectiveness, we have to develop the skills and
understanding on how to surface, address and navigate them. It also
requires that we change beliefs we may have about conflict:

  - Most conflicts, especially those living below the surface, **can’t
    be solved or resolved** in the sense of arriving at a place where
    everyone involved is 100% happy and comfortable with the outcome.
    Therefore, a first step in learning to navigate conflict
    productively is to let go of the belief that all conflicts *can* and
    *should* be (re)solved. This is also why we emphasize that conflicts
    can be navigated, not necessarily resolved;
  - Conflict is a **natural part of human collaboration**. It happens to
    everyone, no matter how skilled you are, how non-violent your
    communication is and how considerate you are of others. Conflict in
    itself is not bad or something that should be avoided. In fact,
    conflict is a great source of learning and growth, provided we learn
    how to navigate it productively;
  - **Conflictsdon’t disappear when we choose to ignore or avoid them**.
    Overwhelmingly, research shows that open-minded conversation is the
    best way forward. And this is hard. It requires that we learn how to
    develop and express our ideas and emotions, that we understand and
    empathize with other views, that we integrate and create new ideas
    together and that we have to agree to implement relevant solutions
    (Johnson et al. 2014);
  - Although not all conflicts can be truly solved in the sense of
    finding a solution, often the act of **talking about it openly** and
    showing the effect it has on each of us is an important step
    forward. This will be messy and difficult no matter how skilled you
    are. And that’s fine;

Although surfacing elephants can be messy, difficult work, it rewards
teams with growth and learning when done productively. Bringing an
elephant to the surface also frees up significant psychological
resources; instead of complaining about their teammates at the dinner
table, team members can redirect that energy into solving problems,
coming up with new ideas, and rejuvenating outside of work. Teams that
learn how to surface elephants can dance with conflict instead of
running away from it.

**Conflict Styles: What Sciences Says**



<div class="panelContent">

## Conflicts are about (unmet) needs

One question that often pops up is: when is something a conflict? One
distinction that is commonly made is between conflicts that are
disagreements on how to proceed on a shared task and conflicts that are
about feelings of animosity with another person. But this distinction is
not clearcut, as even a difference of opinion can be taken very
personally (e.g. Simons and Peterson, 2000).

> “A way to understand conflict is to understand it in terms of unmet
> needs \[ … \] Most conflicts in our day-to-day life are about unmet
> social needs.”

A simpler way to understand conflict is to understand it in terms of
unmet needs. Some needs can be very tangible, such as a salary raise or
getting something that is owned by someone else. Or it may be about
getting someone to see your point of view. But most conflicts in our
day-to-day life are about unmet social needs; the need to be seen and
respected by others, to be accepted, to be heard and listened to and to
feel valuable. The extent to which they manifest are deeply personal and
influenced by our culture, personality, and history. These conflicts are
often hard to see and often experienced acutely by one party but not at
all by the other party.

Although light conflict is not necessarily cause for alarm, scientific
research overwhelmingly shows that all-but-the-lightest conflict has a
negative effect on the productivity of teams (De Dreu & Weingart, 2003).
This means that the ability to effectively navigate conflicts is crucial
for any group of people wanting to work together productively.

## How can we navigate conflict?

When we find ourselves in conflict with the needs or goals of others,
there are different styles for how to navigate it. The past decades,
social and organisational psychologists have converged predominantly on
the Dual Concern Model (Pruitt & Rubin, 1986). It states that when we
find ourselves in conflict, two aspects determine how we approach it
intuitively: our ability to assert our own needs and our ability to
empathize with the needs of the other(s). Based on these two dimensions,
five styles emerge:

  - We can **avoid** the conflict by withdrawing from it. This can be
    done actively, by changing the subject or by physically moving away.
    But avoidance can also be done passively by not talking about it, by
    trying to remain neutral or by avoiding certain people,
    relationships or “hot” topics;
  - We can **yield** by giving in to the other for the sake of harmony.
    This is usually driven by a fear of conflict and how hurtful they
    can be. But yielding can also take the shape of understating how
    conflict affects you, by smoothing it over or by maintaining (an
    often fake);
  - We can **force** our needs onto the other(s) by taking an aggressive
    stance with the aim to win. This can take the shape of putting
    pressure on others, issuing threats and ultimatums, insulting them
    or even using physical violence;
  - We can use **problem-solving** or **integration** to seek ways to
    resolve a conflict in a way that meets the needs of both parties.
    This takes the shape of actively confronting the conflict together
    and openly talking about it. By objectively evaluating different
    viewpoints and experiences, we often find entirely new and creative
    solutions;
  - Finally, we can **compromise** by giving everyone involved part of
    what they want, but not enough to make them truly happy with the
    outcomes. This style risks being a lazy form of the integrative
    style;

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3685/1*rbDXZse_BU4ISpBAd10Ijw.jpeg)

## Which style is the best one?

Research has shown that **Integration** is the most effective way to
navigate conflict in the majority of situations (for an overview, see
Friedman et. al. 2000). Because this style takes the needs of all
parties into account, it has the highest chance of resulting in gains
for everyone. But more importantly, this style builds both the skills,
trust and an environment where further conflict can be navigated more
effectively. Research shows that groups and individuals using this style
experience less stressful conflict afterward. Contrary, the other styles
tend to result in degradation of trust, safety and an environment where
future conflict is amplified.

> “Research has shown that **Integration** is the most effective way to
> navigate conflict in the majority of situations”

## How can Liberating Structures help?

So if an integrative style is preferable, what can you do to make this
possible for yourself or in your team? We strongly believe that — among
other approaches — Liberating Structures create an environment where
people can express both their own concerns as well as listen to those of
others. These are some suggestions:

  - ‘[Heard, Seen, Respected](http://bit.ly/33wB0qi)’ is all about
    building empathy and understanding for others when it comes to unmet
    social needs. It is a great structure to help teams build the skills
    they need to actively listen to others, as well as express where
    their social needs where unmet;
  - You can use ‘[Integrated\~Autonomy](http://bit.ly/2P2W3xf)’ to help
    groups find solutions that allow both sides to gain, instead of just
    one or none at all;
  - You can use ‘[TRIZ](http://bit.ly/2XAbFYW)’ to help teams playfully
    identify all the things they can do to guarantee that they won’t be
    able to navigate conflicts in such a way that everyone gains, and
    then identify what it is they already may be doing;
  - You can use ‘[What I Need From You](http://bit.ly/2XAbDAi)’ to allow
    people to clearly express (social) needs and receive clear
    responses. Although this may be a difficult process, the clarity it
    creates builds both trust and understanding;

Interdepartmental Communication

**The importance of Interdepartmental Communication**



<div class="panelContent">

Interdepartmental communication is communication between a business’s
departments. Departments might need to talk about shared projects, new
promotions, changes in goods or services, [sales
projections](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/accounting/training/blog/sales-projections-small-business-owners/),
or anything else that might affect multiple departments.
Interdepartmental communication can be as simple as a departmental email
update or a more complex meeting about a shared project.

Communication between departments is sometimes called cross-departmental
communication.

If your business has multiple departments or even just employees who do
vastly different tasks, you must be aware of interdepartmental
communication. Even at small businesses, where it’s easier to
communicate with co-workers, there are ways to improve communication
between departments.

## What is interdepartmental communication?

Interdepartmental communication is communication between a business’s
departments. Departments might need to talk about shared projects, new
promotions, changes in goods or services, [sales
projections](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/accounting/training/blog/sales-projections-small-business-owners/),
or anything else that might affect multiple departments.
Interdepartmental communication can be as simple as a departmental email
update or a more complex meeting about a shared project.

Communication between departments is sometimes called cross-departmental
communication.

## The importance of interdepartmental communication

Your business will perform better when your teams communicate with each
other.

Effective interdepartmental communication keeps information moving. A
team doesn’t keep all its information to itself. Instead, it shares
information with other teams so everyone can do their best work.

For example, when your marketing department begins advertising a new
promotion, the marketing team should tell the sales department. The
sales department needs to know about the promotion, such as the start
and end dates, so it can make sure customers receive the deal they saw.
If the sales team doesn’t know the details, there will likely be
frustrated customers.

Once the sales team makes a sale, it must communicate with the people
who handle [accounts
receivable](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/accounting/training/blog/what-are-accounts-receivable/).
If they don’t know about the sale, they won’t know that they need to
collect money, and your business will lose income.

Customers receive better service when your business has good
interdepartmental communication. When teams communicate, everyone has
the same service, offerings, and billing.

When people or entire departments are only focused on speed and
self-promotion, communication will break down. Important information
will not travel. People will lack the knowledge to best complete their
tasks. Customers will not receive the best service. And when customers
aren’t served well, they’ll take their money elsewhere.

Lack of communication can lead to conflict. People will fight. Teams
will distrust each other. Finger pointing will happen as teams blame
each other for mistakes and inefficiency.

Your business must develop positive interdepartmental communication to
prevent conflict, increase efficiency, and satisfy customers.

<div id="expander-control-404121568" class="expand-control">

Build relationships



<div id="expander-content-404121568" class="expand-content">

Employees should build relationships with people outside of their
departments. Stronger relationships increase trust, which leads to an
improved ability to work together.

Employees might grow relationships by inviting co-workers for coffee or
lunch. They might also do activities together after work.

You can organize events where employees can get to know each other. You
can host holiday parties, seasonal get-togethers, or achievement
celebrations. Encourage employees to talk to people outside of their
departments. To promote interdepartmental mingling, you can assign
seating.





<div id="expander-671327918" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-671327918" class="expand-control">

Meet regularly



<div id="expander-content-671327918" class="expand-content">

Encourage your employees to meet regularly. If you need to, schedule
regular times when employees across departments can meet.

When employees meet, they should seek out ways to help each other.
Employees should share their needs. They can ask co-workers to help on
projects.

Train employees to think about others, not just themselves. Selflessness
will promote communication and cooperation between departments.





<div id="expander-1206833749" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1206833749" class="expand-control">

Create action items



<div id="expander-content-1206833749" class="expand-content">

Communication shouldn’t end when an interdepartmental meeting ends.

Meetings shouldn’t just be information dumps where employees spew facts
about what they’re working on. Your employees should use meetings to
also create goals and action items.

Employees should leave the meeting with tasks that will help their
co-workers and improve the business. Employees can divide up tasks, or
you can assign tasks to each person.





<div id="expander-927378083" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-927378083" class="expand-control">

Use familiar terms



<div id="expander-content-927378083" class="expand-content">

Each department uses their own terminology. While everyone in the
department might know what the terms mean, it might be jargon to
employees in other departments. Unfamiliar terms can cause confusion and
alienate those who don’t understand.

When employees from different departments work together, they should
explain their terminology. In some cases, it might be better to leave
behind departmental terms and use other words that are familiar to
everyone.





<div id="expander-957655989" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-957655989" class="expand-control">

Remove physical barriers



<div id="expander-content-957655989" class="expand-content">

Sometimes, communication can struggle if there are physical barriers in
the way. For example, if one or all of your employees work remotely,
it’ll be more difficult to have regular communication. [Flexible work
arrangements](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/payroll/training/blog/the-benefits-of-flexible-work-schedules/) can
be great for individuals, but bad for teams if the proper systems aren’t
in place.

Give employees the things they need to communicate effectively. If you
have remote employees, make sure everyone has access to email, online
chat tools, and video conferencing software. For employees in your
workplace, make sure they have meeting places where they won’t disturb
others.





<div id="expander-957011934" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-957011934" class="expand-control">

Focus on company needs



<div id="expander-content-957011934" class="expand-content">

Your employees will be tempted to think about themselves and ways they
can grow. They will want to compete for personal advancement. When
employees are competing against each other, they won’t have strong
communication. They will only communicate when it helps themselves.

Teach your employees to think about the business’s needs. Make sure they
regularly think about how to advance and improve your business. Show
employees that there isn’t an “us vs. them” battle. Instead, there is
only the company and what is best for it.

When employees are focused on the single goal to improve the business,
they will work better together.

When an Employee Quits



<div id="expander-content-629660858" class="expand-content">

If you're blindsided by an employee's departure, you're doing something
wrong. 

Employees ideally should feel comfortable telling their managers if they
feel unhappy or unsatisfied, says Julie Zhuo, author and vice president
of product design at Facebook. Unexpected departures can also
cause [serious disruption to business operations and
profits](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-your-best-employees-are-going-to-quit-2016-10). 

Zhuo recommends checking in with employees regularly so you can have a
better sense when employees feel dissatisfied: "I wouldn't want to be
surprised and think that somehow they were perfectly happy and that
everything was roses when they announced that they're going to do
something else," Zhou [told Business
Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-vp-julie-zhuo-boss-employee-relationship-2019-4).

When an employee hates you



<div id="expander-content-1879038052" class="expand-content">

If you can't detect when employees hate them or feel unhappy with your
management, there's a problem.

Although employees work hard to keep their true feelings about a boss
secret, managers should be on the radar for subtle signs there's
dissatisfaction among their ranks (signs range from a lack of eye
contact to refusing to smile at you).

Learning when your employees don't like you can prevent them from
quitting and boost productivity, international business speaker and
author Michael Kerr told [Business
Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-your-employees-secretly-hate-you-2015-9#theyre-short-with-you-10).
"If your employees are beginning to sound like your moody teenager, then
that's a pretty big red flag," he said.

When an employee is bored



<div id="expander-content-1805253866" class="expand-content">

Good managers always know when employees are spending more time
scrolling social media or internet shopping than working.

Employees that are constantly bored will have more of an incentive to
quit, Lynn Taylor, workplace expert and author of "[Tame Your Terrible
Office
Tyrant](https://www.amazon.com/Tame-Your-Terrible-Office-Tyrant/dp/0470457643/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1248579303&sr=8-1&tag=bisafetynet-20safetynet-20),"
told [Business
Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-you-should-quit-your-job-2017-7#youre-bored-all-the-time-1).
If an employee tries telling you they no longer feel challenged, you'd
be better off taking them seriously.

<div id="expander-control-592983089" class="expand-control">

When your employee fails



<div id="expander-content-592983089" class="expand-content">

Employees want to be challenged, so setting them up for failure may help
them in the long run.

Jake Poses, CEO of teaching startup JumpRope, [purposely gives his
younger employees a task that's too
big](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-manage-millennials-2017-11).
The practice of "goal-setting" also occurs at Google, where
managers [expect employees to fall
short](https://www.businessinsider.com/laszlo-bock-googlers-arent-expected-to-hit-all-their-goals-2016-3) of
their given tasks.

Expecting failure from employees not only helps challenge them, but also
lets you know the true all-stars who can somehow master the assignment.

When an employee comes to you with suggestions on how to improve



<div id="expander-content-2044756466" class="expand-content">

Good managers will expect employees to come to them with suggestions on
things they can do better.

Creating a culture where employees feel comfortable coming to you with
"[feedforward](https://www.businessinsider.com/marshall-goldsmith-feedforward-2016-8)"
— or suggestions on how to improve in the future — can improve workplace
morale without having awkward conversations about a manager's
shortcomings. In fact, refusing to seek feedback is the biggest mistake
leaders can make, a former Google executive Meg Crosby [told Business
Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/former-google-exec-meg-crosby-top-mistake-leaders-make-2016-4).

"The more CEOs \[and leaders\] can get that very candid feedback and
value that and understand it and think about it as they're making
decisions, the better the decisions they will make," Crosby said.

What your employee's weakness is



<div id="expander-content-1010235269" class="expand-content">

Employers rarely inquire about their workers' shortcomings — but they
should, says Sarah Wagener, chief people officer at DoorDash.

Wagener encourages managers to [create a space where employees feel
comfortable talking about their
weaknesses](https://www.businessinsider.com/boss-employees-areas-for-improvement-2018-12).
Creating a culture where employees can openly state their weaknesses
will allow good managers to help them improve, while helping workers
find more avenues for career growth.

Whether you need to fire an employee

No one likes handing out pink slips, but good managers [need to know
when to fire an

"It's a necessity if you want to have a thriving business," says John
Rampton, entrepreneur and founder of productivity
service [Calendar](https://www.calendar.com/).

When employees are gone more often than not, are argumentative, or
customers despise them, these are signs [your workers have overstayed

Humble leaders, including those open to their employees' ideas and

When a new hire won’t last very long



<div id="expander-content-499951700" class="expand-content">

Hiring can be a gamble; you never truly know how good an employee is
before you hire them. 

Good managers, however, [stay aware of signs that a new hire won't make
it out of the probation
period](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-new-employee-wont-last-long-2017-5). 

If your new hire won't talk to team members, strays from company
policies, and poaches responsibilities from others, a good manager might
have to ask them to leave.

What an employee’s ultimate career goals are



<div id="expander-content-658152264" class="expand-content">

If you don't know what your employee's ultimate career goals are, you
are practically handing them a reason to leave.

In fact, talking about career-development is crucial to retaining
talent, [Harvard Business Review
reports](https://hbr.org/2008/02/are-you-giving-your-top-perfor). HBR
found better career development opportunities was the primary reason
most employees left for different companies — even above higher pay.

Yet many managers find talking to employees about career development can
be time consuming or awkward. To get to know what your employee's
ultimate career objectives are, HBR recommends managers simply bite the
bullet
and [ask](https://hbr.org/2008/02/are-you-giving-your-top-perfor).

Managers may be torn over [whether a forgotten thank-you note calls for
disqualification](https://www.businessinsider.com/thank-you-notes-interview-job-2019-4) from
a job, but there are some clear-cut reasons not to hire a candidate.

If a candidate has poor references, comes unprepared to interviews, and
cannot follow job-application
directions, [JobMonkey](https://www.jobmonkey.com/employer-insights/reasons-not-hire-someone/) argues
there should be little to no surprise that the candidate does not take
the role seriously enough to be considered.

When an employee asks for a raise



<div id="expander-content-131539987" class="expand-content">

Getting blindsided by an employee asking for more money can lead to
awkward, tricky conversations for managers.

“No manager should go into any review winging it, not just for raise
purposes,” Karan Dillon, former editor of the Harvard Business Review,
told [The
Muse](https://www.themuse.com/advice/ultimate-guide-managers-responding-raise-promotion-requests-review-season).

To better prepare for getting asked about a raise, managers should tell
employees before performance reviews whether or not the budget allows
for a raise, and put the work in to evaluate whether employee
performance exceeds expectations.

<div id="expander-control-660605664" class="expand-control">

When an employee gives you criticism



<div id="expander-content-660605664" class="expand-content">

Receiving negative feedback from your employees can be a tough pill to
swallow. If you're not expecting the feedback, you run the risk of
getting defensive, over-apologizing, and acting on emotion — all ways to
ruin your professional reputation, says [The
Muse](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-ways-not-to-handle-negative-feedback).

Instead, good managers should prepare themselves to receive criticism
from direct reports. [Harvard Business
Review](https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-right-way-to-respond-to-negative-feedback) suggests
forming a group of "loving critics," or trustworthy sources that will be
brutally honest about your performance when asked.

<div id="expander-control-701907845" class="expand-control">

There's a change in their appearance



<div id="expander-content-701907845" class="expand-content">

If they start dressing unusually sharply, it may be because they are
slipping out to job interviews during or after work, says Kerr.

"Also, if someone is unhappy in their job, they may begin to dress down
because they feel that no one is really paying attention anyway — or
because they just don't really care anymore," adds Taylor.





<div id="expander-1973994856" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1973994856" class="expand-control">

You hear other companies are interested in them



<div id="expander-content-1973994856" class="expand-content">

If this is your best employee, it's not so surprising that they're
highly sought-after in their field. Once you hear other companies are
requesting meetings with this person, you may have something to worry
about.





<div id="expander-635053459" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-635053459" class="expand-control">

They start taking more time off



<div id="expander-content-635053459" class="expand-content">

If this employee is normally doesn't miss work, but then begins calling
in sick more often, or using up their vacation days sporadically, it may
mean they are feeling very disengaged at work, possibly even to the
point of using the time off to search for other employment, says Kerr.

"And using up their sick days and vacation time (and even getting a lot
of dental work done suddenly) might be a red flag that they are getting
ready to jump ship and want to make sure they max out any benefits they
feel owed to them."





  

<div id="expander-629211880" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-629211880" class="expand-control">

They show a drop off in any interest in work



<div id="expander-content-629211880" class="expand-content">

Have you noticed that one of your top employees has stopped offering
helpful suggestions or ideas at meetings, they offer little input into
new projects, or seem suddenly disinterested in any of the broader
details related to work? 

"This can be a sign they've lost their mojo and no longer really care
what happens down the road because they know they won't be there in the
future," Kerr says.





<div id="expander-203920174" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-203920174" class="expand-control">

They were recently passed over for a promotion or a raise they deserved



<div id="expander-content-203920174" class="expand-content">

When someone is up for a raise or promotion (that they deserve) and they
don't get it, it can be very frustrating and discouraging.

The employee will likely feel undervalued and may be inclined to go look
for employment with a company that would appreciate and reward them for
their contributions.





  

<div id="expander-1167035332" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1167035332" class="expand-control">

They lack a sense of humor



<div id="expander-content-1167035332" class="expand-content">

Employees who are about to bail may no longer joke around, says Taylor.
"Their demeanor is more straightforward and factual versus friendly and
lighthearted. Perhaps this is because they're less worried about
appearing supportive or trying to impress anyone."





<div id="expander-1904035326" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1904035326" class="expand-control">

You can read it in their body language and facial expressions



<div id="expander-content-1904035326" class="expand-content">

Subtle clues might give hints that your employees are either disengaged
or even feeling guilty because they've been job hunting and they know
that they are not sticking around for the long run, Kerr explains.





  

<div id="expander-1516978265" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1516978265" class="expand-control">

They seem distant



<div id="expander-content-1516978265" class="expand-content">

Do you feel a sudden chill when you approach one of your employees? "The
first few times, you chalk up to their having a bad day. Then you notice
it among more team members ... more frequently," says Taylor. If this is
the case, one or more employees may be preparing to leave.





<div id="expander-409887656" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-409887656" class="expand-control">

They've been demoted



<div id="expander-content-409887656" class="expand-content">

Similarly to being passed over for a promotion, an employee who is
demoted will likely feel pretty dejected and may decide to take their
talents elsewhere. If they happen to be one of your top employees, a
demotion can be especially difficult and frustrating for them.  





  

<div id="expander-442049826" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-442049826" class="expand-control">

There's a noted change in attitude



<div id="expander-content-442049826" class="expand-content">

They may become more irritable, or they may make more sarcastic comments
than normal about work-related issues, revealing a lack of fundamental
belief in the direction the company is headed, says Kerr.

A sudden lack of enthusiasm is also a big sign you may be losing one or
more of your employees, Taylor adds.





<div id="expander-1234479246" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1234479246" class="expand-control">

There are changes in their behavior



<div id="expander-content-1234479246" class="expand-content">

If they are acting differently — maybe they're suddenly keeping to
themselves more and more, or they begin going out to lunch with
coworkers every day — the employee may be pulling away from work
or commiserating with colleagues.

"If****any team members who rarely went to lunch together before are now
doing so, they may be discussing their plans to move on," says Taylor.
"Seeing new behavior in who goes to lunch and how often, however, is
certainly no cause for concern if other signs are not evident."





  

<div id="expander-1480149431" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1480149431" class="expand-control">

They're underpaid

If you know for a fact that this employee is [worth more than your
company is paying
them](http://www.businessinsider.com/signs-you-are-underpaid-2016-10)...
and you think they know it, too ... they may be looking
elsewhere. Feeling like you might be underpaid can be one of the most
disheartening aspects of work.





<div id="expander-1182064153" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1182064153" class="expand-control">

They tell you about major changes on the home front



<div id="expander-content-1182064153" class="expand-content">

If there's a major disruption in their family life, this may lead to
them looking for new opportunities for a host of reasons (to be closer
to home, for example, or to work in a less stressful environment), Kerr
explains.





  

<div id="expander-614660162" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-614660162" class="expand-control">

Their productivity drops



<div id="expander-content-614660162" class="expand-content">

If an employee who is normally extremely productive and punctual
suddenly starts turning reports in late, or their sales have
fallen dramatically, something might be going on. "Any behavioral
changes that point to 'presenteeism' — the phenomenon of employees
showing up at work without being fully present — are huge red flags,"
says Kerr.





<div id="expander-2058903895" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-2058903895" class="expand-control">

They approach conflict differently



<div id="expander-content-2058903895" class="expand-content">

When people are ready to bolt, they may change how they handle
disagreements, Taylor explains. "If they tended to push back before,
they may no longer do so because they don't feel it's worth the bother.
They have emotionally checked out."

However, someone who was generally agreeable before may become more
argumentative out of frustration or resentment, she says.





<div id="expander-1585825014" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1585825014" class="expand-control">

They're uncomfortable discussing long-term projects and deadlines



<div id="expander-content-1585825014" class="expand-content">

If your employees are seeking greener pastures, they will become visibly
uncomfortable discussing projects that are several months out, says
Taylor. "When longer-term deadlines involve them directly, they'll
attempt to be noncommittal or vague."





<div id="expander-126393849" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-126393849" class="expand-control">

Colleagues tell you they think something's going on



<div id="expander-content-126393849" class="expand-content">

If your coworkers approach you with concerns that something's changed or
"something's going on" with a specific employee, they may be on to
something.

"Other colleagues closer to the action may read the signs well before
you do, so if they bring concerns forward, pay attention," says Kerr.





<div id="expander-1529621021" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1529621021" class="expand-control">

They stay under the communications radar

"If one of your team members is contemplating resignation, they're less
likely to communicate often — by email, in person, or in general," says
Taylor. "The thinking is that, to the extent they're less accessible,
they won't risk being put on the spot ... answering sensitive questions
that could jeopardize their job when they're not yet ready to move."





<div id="expander-1636137507" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1636137507" class="expand-control">

Their schedule suddenly changes



<div id="expander-content-1636137507" class="expand-content">

When they start keeping unusual hours — working later, arriving late,
shifting their hours in any noticeable way — it could be because they
are searching for work or interviewing with other employers while still
trying to balance their current workload, says Kerr.





<div id="expander-1230341913" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1230341913" class="expand-control">

You inquire about possible issues, but get little feedback



<div id="expander-content-1230341913" class="expand-content">

Do they seem closed off? Are they not willing to work through issues
with you?

"If one of your team members or several of them already have one foot
out the door, they'll act as if nothing is wrong when you address any
issues," says Taylor. This may be because they have already shut
down and mentally moved on.





<div id="expander-18734000" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-18734000" class="expand-control">

You have a bad gut feeling



<div id="expander-content-18734000" class="expand-content">

If you feel awkward moments in your office more often or a
discomfort around your team you can't explain, this may be a
sign they're about to quit. "Your instincts count for a lot and most
people don't put enough stock in them; instead, they second-guess
themselves."

Trust your gut. There's a good chance it's right.

**Positive Signs**

Signs your team likes you



<div id="expander-content-227262783" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

Are you striking the right balance between commanding respect and
appearing accessible? Are your employees responding well to your style
of leadership? Are any of your actions breeding resentment in the
office?

Being a good boss is crucial for your organization — a third of
employees in one survey revealed that they'd quit a job because of a bad
manager

But you can't exactly go wandering around the office begging people to
tell you how you're doing. You're better off organizing employee
satisfaction surveys and soliciting feedback from your direct reports.

You can also take a look at these other, more subtle signs that you're
killing it as a boss:

<div id="expander-1657381669" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1657381669" class="expand-control">

You don't have obvious favorites



<div id="expander-content-1657381669" class="expand-content">

Playing favorites is a great way to torpedo office morale. If you make
it clear that a certain person is the apple of your eye no matter what,
then that'll just encourage your other employees to give up on trying to
impress you.





<div id="expander-13040184" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-13040184" class="expand-control">

You treat your employees like human beings



<div id="expander-content-13040184" class="expand-content">

Unfortunately, some bosses seem to feel that hurling insults and abuse
at people is an effective motivational technique. In most cases, this
simply isn't true. If you value your employees as human beings, then
you're already a huge step above many managers.





<div id="expander-1321203269" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1321203269" class="expand-control">

You're willing to try new things



<div id="expander-content-1321203269" class="expand-content">

Good bosses adopt certain methods because they're the best way of doing
things — not because they've just fallen into certain habits. The best
managers give their employees a little room to experiment and innovate.





<div id="expander-1447423408" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1447423408" class="expand-control">

You hold everyone accountable...



<div id="expander-content-1447423408" class="expand-content">

Maintaining accountability is a big part of office morale, and it
encourages workers to act with integrity, leading to an excellent
workplace culture.





<div id="expander-2069250157" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-2069250157" class="expand-control">

... including yourself



<div id="expander-content-2069250157" class="expand-content">

Good bosses don't pick a scapegoat or explain away mistakes. In fact,
experienced managers admit it when they fail in order to create a
workplace that's a safe environment for experimentation.





<div id="expander-703513693" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-703513693" class="expand-control">

You ask politely



<div id="expander-content-703513693" class="expand-content">

Insecure bosses bark out orders and behave like divas in order to
establish their dominance. If you always say the magic word and are
generally polite, then that's definitely a good sign.





<div id="expander-450051917" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-450051917" class="expand-control">

You give support



<div id="expander-content-450051917" class="expand-content">

Bosses should build trust with their employees by providing a reasonable
amount of support and guidance. Obviously, you don't need to hold
anyone's hand, but throwing people into the deep end isn't ideal,
either.





<div id="expander-145544020" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-145544020" class="expand-control">

You remove obstacles



<div id="expander-content-145544020" class="expand-content">

Bad bosses throw up roadblocks that make it harder for people to succeed
and do their jobs. Great managers should actively work to make the lives
of their employees easier.





<div id="expander-2008816775" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-2008816775" class="expand-control">

You're a good coach



<div id="expander-content-2008816775" class="expand-content">

Coaches don't just sit back on the sidelines twiddling their thumbs. But
they don't run onto the field and start playing, either — unless they're
that one scary dad who takes the youth recreational soccer league way
too seriously.

Good bosses are like good coaches: They command respect and provide the
right blend of praise and constructive criticism to bring out the best
in their employees.





<div id="expander-1413980130" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1413980130" class="expand-control">

You're able to manage expectations



<div id="expander-content-1413980130" class="expand-content">

Bad bosses often disappoint or confuse their teams by presenting
inaccurate pictures about how things are at the office — e.g., talking
up how well the company's doing and then springing news of layoffs on
everyone. Good managers are honest and open.





<div id="expander-1823566399" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1823566399" class="expand-control">

You give feedback



<div id="expander-content-1823566399" class="expand-content">

Good employees crave feedback to learn how they can improve and grow.
Great bosses are happy to oblige.





<div id="expander-866439591" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-866439591" class="expand-control">

You keep the environment open and transparent



<div id="expander-content-866439591" class="expand-content">

Transparency makes for [a happy office
culture.](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-transparent-is-your-workplace-2014-9)





<div id="expander-364120076" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-364120076" class="expand-control">

You ask for insight



<div id="expander-content-364120076" class="expand-content">

Employees want to feel heard.

Obviously, at the end of the day, you're responsible for making the
final judgment. But once in a while, if the situation calls for it, good
bosses reach out to their workers to get their insights and opinions.





<div id="expander-700029534" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-700029534" class="expand-control">

You explain yourself



<div id="expander-content-700029534" class="expand-content">

Good managers don't expect anyone to read their minds. They outline a
clear vision and provide their team with the knowledge and tools to
achieve it.





<div id="expander-636768467" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-636768467" class="expand-control">

You care about solutions



<div id="expander-content-636768467" class="expand-content">

When the going gets tough, the weak bosses find someone to blame. Good
managers focus on finding a solution to the problem, rather than
throwing people under the bus.





<div id="expander-1545192452" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1545192452" class="expand-control">

You care about challenging your employees



<div id="expander-content-1545192452" class="expand-content">

Bored workers are unhappy workers. The best bosses check in with their
workers to ensure that they're being challenged.





<div id="expander-433198921" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-433198921" class="expand-control">

You don't micromanage, but you're not too hands-off



<div id="expander-content-433198921" class="expand-content">

Carefully examine the capabilities of your workers in order to achieve a
good balance. Could you give any of them more responsibilities? Is there
anything you can start delegating?





<div id="expander-495172061" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-495172061" class="expand-control">

You check in with your employees



<div id="expander-content-495172061" class="expand-content">

You don't pop in to nag people like Bill Lumbergh in "Office Space." You
genuinely check in to talk to — not *at* — your employees in order to
find out their goals and worries.





<div id="expander-425332232" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-425332232" class="expand-control">

You have a sense of humor



<div id="expander-content-425332232" class="expand-content">

It's important to never take the joking too far in the office. That
being said, good bosses take their work seriously — not themselves. It's
good to have a laugh with your employees.





<div id="expander-237762981" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-237762981" class="expand-control">

You care about the dreams and goals of your employees



<div id="expander-content-237762981" class="expand-content">

The best bosses are invested in their employees. That means that they're
actively concerned with the professional goals and aspirations of their
workers.





<div id="expander-1819631913" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1819631913" class="expand-control">

You're not nice just for the sake of being nice



<div id="expander-content-1819631913" class="expand-content">

Being too nice of a boss can actually be rather cruel, as Betty Liu
points out in a LinkedIn article. Artificially sweet managers heap on
undeserved praise, then yank the rug out from under their employees
later on.

So don't play nice because you don't like conflict. Be authentic and
real with your workers. You'll be doing them a big favor.





<div id="expander-2147452333" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-2147452333" class="expand-control">

You're a good listener



<div id="expander-content-2147452333" class="expand-content">

This is the main reason why introverts make quite good bosses.

Many people have had a manager who *loved* to talk. Rarer — and
infinitely more appreciated — are those bosses who are quality
listeners. Good listening skills shows your employees that you're
seriously considering their opinions and needs.





<div id="expander-1632264636" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1632264636" class="expand-control">

You take an interest in your employees' lives



<div id="expander-content-1632264636" class="expand-content">

Good bosses don't cross the line into nosiness. Still, they care enough
to ask about peoples' summer plans, kids, and elderly parents. This
interest will demonstrate to employees that their boss actually cares
about them, making both parties more invested in their working
relationship.





<div id="expander-1740374578" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1740374578" class="expand-control">

You tailor your approach



<div id="expander-content-1740374578" class="expand-content">

Different employees have different needs. "One size fits all" just isn't
going to cut it in the workplace. The best bosses are flexible. This
allows them to fulfill all sorts of roles in order to better cater to
the needs of their workers.





<div id="expander-2065253573" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-2065253573" class="expand-control">

You demand effort, not perfection



<div id="expander-content-2065253573" class="expand-content">

Great leaders demand — and inspire — employees to work hard. They lead
by example and give workers the tools they need to succeed through hard
work.

Bosses who are too rigid are simply unrealistic. People make mistakes.
It happens. If you punish small failures, you'll just stifle innovation,
experimentation and proactivity in your office.





<div id="expander-1840600740" class="expand-container">

<div id="expander-control-1840600740" class="expand-control">

You suspect you're an awful leader sometimes



<div id="expander-content-1840600740" class="expand-content">

When [Business Insider previously spoke with author Simon Sinek about
leadership](http://www.businessinsider.com/thinking-youre-a-good-leader-could-mean-youre-a-terrible-one-2016-10),
he explained that individuals who believe themselves to be excellent
leaders are often, in fact, terrible leaders.

Great bosses recognize that authority and rank do not equal leadership
abilities. As a result, they are constantly working to improve
themselves. These quality bosses might even feel inadequate at times.

However, just the fact that they recognize their own flaws renders them
superior to many managers that totally lack self-awareness.

Exit Interview



<div id="expander-content-403861239" class="expand-content">

Author: [Ryan Kajiura](https://wiki.pinnacle.com/display/~ryank)

  

An **exit interview** is a survey conducted with an individual who is
separating from
an [organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization "Organization") or
relationship. Most commonly, this occurs between
an [employee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee "Employee") and an
organization, a student and an educational institution, or a member and
an association. An organization can use the information gained from an
exit [interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview "Interview") to
assess what should be improved, changed, or remain intact. More so, an
organization can use the results from exit interviews to reduce
employee, student, or
member [turnover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_\(employment\) "Turnover (employment)") and
increase [productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity "Productivity") and
engagement, thus reducing the high costs associated with turnover.

The real reason businesses conduct exit interviews is to get information
about an employee’s work experience with the company.  This information
could be valuable all on its own or used with other exit interview
data.  To gather relevant information, there are a few things to keep
in mind when structuring the exit interview process.

  

This may be your employer’s last chance to ask for formal feedback from
you. They’d love to know why you’ve opted to leave, and what you really
think about them. That way they can strive to reduce future turnover and
fix internal problems.  
  
So they set up a meeting to ask for your opinions. At larger employers
the session could be with Human Resources, or even with an external
supplier who specializes in such consultations. In smaller
establishments you might meet with a manager from another division.

  

<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Prepare**



<div class="panelContent">

Managers or Team Leads

  - Set up a 30 mins to 1 hour 1 on 1 meeting with the employee that is
    leaving. It would be good to send an Outlook meeting to block out
    time in both calendar.
  - Do not use the word exit, leave, leaving in the meeting subject. Do
    not provide any indication that it is an exit interview
  - Ensure the meeting is an open two way communication





  

  

<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;">

**Questions to Ask**



<div class="panelContent">

  

  - Why are you leaving your current position?
  - How would you describe the culture of our company?
  - How do you feel things went here?
  - Do you have suggestions for improvements?
  - Where are we coming up short?
  - Was there a particular reason you’ve decided to move on?
  - What could we have done that would have persuaded you to stay?
  - What is your new employer giving you that you did not get from us?
  - How does your new job fulfill your career goals?
  - Would you like us to stay in touch to let you know about future
    opportunities?
