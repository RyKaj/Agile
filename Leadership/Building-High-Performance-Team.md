# Leadership : Building High Performance Team


## Dimensions That Deliver High Performance

A team is more than a group of people who work together. A high performing team is a group of people who share a common vision, goals, metrics and who collaborate, challenge and hold each other accountable to achieve outstanding results. You know a high performing team because the members:

  - Have a clear and vision of where they are headed and what they want to accomplish
  - Are excited about that vision because they took part in creating it
  - Act from clearly defined priorities
  - Have clear measures of success and receive feedback about how they’re doing
  - Maintain open communication and positive relationships with each other
  - Identify and solve problems
  - Make decisions when and where they occur
  - Successfully manage conflict
  - Share leadership responsibilities
  - Participate in productive meetings
  - Have clearly defined roles and work procedures
  - Cooperate cross-functionally

Solid teams are the foundation of a high performance organization and developing those teams is an effort that requires serious effort and consistent discipline. The modules in this program are not informational. They walk a team, step-by-step, through a process to take responsibility to become a high performing team that takes full responsibility for their business results.

## Formula for Building High Performance Teams

> Performance = Team Potential — Outside Interference

### Outside Interference

Interactions and interference from outside of the team can impede on a team’s ability to deliver on its goals.

  - Changing goal posts

A moving target is considerably more difficult to hit than a static one. Changing a team’s goal halfway through the course can kill momentum, have an impact on morale, and requires a boost to propel the team onto the new course. In the past, the lack of a long-term vision caused me to change the goals of my team quite frequently. This led to great frustration within the team and ultimately decreased performance.

  - Leadership changes

Changes in leadership can bring a lot of anxiety within a team. The anxiety often stems from the uncertainty of what changes will be put in place by the new leader of the team, department, or function. The new leader often needs to go through a round of trust-building exercise with every team member, while important and necessary, often slows the team’s delivery.

  - Organizational changes

Similar to leadership changes, changes in organizational structure can have a direct or indirect impact on a team. Mergers and/or splits between departments directly impact the teams under them. Re-alignment needs to occur, new goals have to be set, and current goals may change. The departments not directly involved in the organizational change may have to revisit how they collaborate with the ones that are. Amidst all the changes, individual team performance is affected.

  - Micromanagement

Engineers hate being micromanaged, plain and simple. Anytime I tried to micromanage, or get too deep into the weeds, it resulted in frustrations and ultimately the team slowed down. Give the team a clear problem to solve, a clear direction, and get out of their way.

  - Inter-team interference

In any engineering group comprised of multiple teams working on the same code base or product, no one team can operate fully in a silo. The reality is, a team often has to collaborate with other teams in order to get their own work done. In this scenario, it is very common for the teams to step on each other’s toes which impacts overall delivery. An engineer can be blocked waiting for a pull request from another team. A team can deploy code that introduces a bug in a part of the application which is owned by a different team. An engineer can be blocked waiting for a code review from another team. These are some instances of common inter-team interference that I have observed occur. Proper process and guidelines can help alleviate such inter-team frictions.

## Factors describe the behaviors of leaders who had those high-performance teams

Simon Sinek - Performance vs Trust

[](./attachments/463503809.mp4)

## Team Leaders Inspire More Than They Drive

High-performance teams are more pull than push. Leaders in high-performance teams know how to create energy and enthusiasm in the team. Team members feel inspired, that they are on a mission and what they are doing is of great importance.

## Team Leaders Resolve Conflicts And Increase Cooperation

Conflicts can tear teams apart and leaders need to work to help resolve differences quickly and promote cooperation. Often team leaders assume that mature people will resolve conflict on their own. If that were true, however, there would be no divorce, separations or wars. In high-performance teams differences are addressed quickly and directly. This requires a level of maturity in team members. When people believe that they are trusted and others have their back, disputes can be resolved. Team leaders that focus on competition versus cooperation never achieve outstanding results.

## Team Leaders Set Stretch Goals

Leaders who know how to set stretch goals create an internal drive in the team to accomplish the impossible. People don’t really want to come to work and do something that any other team could accomplish; they want to do something extraordinary. When they accomplish something that is extraordinary they recognize that they personally are capable and competent. Doing something out of the ordinary helps people recognize that they are exceptional and their satisfaction with work, their engagement and pride all go up.

## Team Leaders Communicate, Communicate, Communicate The Vision And Direction

Be a broken record and help team members to be focused on the vision. High-performance team leaders stay on message, they constantly communicate and keep people focused on the vision and mission to accomplish. It’s easy for anyone to get distracted or miss a turn. Shiny objects are all around us and sometimes team members get diverted from their mission. High-performance team leaders keep people informed, up-to-date and on track.

A strong purpose fuels the passion of your employees, and propels them out of bed every morning, excited about the work ahead. No matter what your organization does, there is a higher-level raison d’être that can activate employees to understand how critical it is that you succeed. Without your organization, hundreds, thousands or millions of people would endure unnecessary challenges that make life less gratifying. If you don’t have a clear purpose, then keep asking yourself why your organization matters until you can articulate a very high level problem that your customers, their customers, or the world would face if you ceased to exist.

As a leader, it is your responsibility to ensure that your entire organization knows your purpose, strategy, and how you plan to get there. Employees also need to know their department’s strategy and plans, and understand what success means.

## Team Leaders Are Trusted

If a team leader is not trusted, they can’t be inspiring or trusted to resolve conflicts, get the team to embrace stretch goals or believe their communications. The lack of trust slows down everything. We have found that there are three basic pillars that build trust. The first pillar of trust is relationships. We trust people that we like. We trust our friends and we distrust our enemies. Building a positive relationship increases trust. The second pillar of trust is knowledge or expertise. We trust people that have the right answer or can provide insight. We trust people when they can help solve problems. Use your knowledge and skills to help others solve a problem and it will increase trust. The third pillar of trust is consistency. When you say you will do something and you do it, people trust you. Being consistent and walking your talk makes you a person that can be trusted.

Many leaders feel pressure to immediately begin making changes during their first days on the job. While acting quickly gives your higher-ups the confidence that you are capable of adding value from day one, it frequently creates barriers and blockers further down the road. This desire to act swiftly, while in good faith, often communicates a lack of regard for existing structures, and tells your team that you don’t think they are smart enough to have thought through their prior decisions and actions. In my experience, this is one of the fastest ways to lose trust and put team members on the defensive, creating an unnecessary need to save face, and making it harder for new leaders to gain the support of their teams when they begin implementing required changes.

When people see their leader show up with an open mind, and respect for all the work that has been done, they feel more comfortable buying into the recommended changes.

## Create Psychological Safely

Many people work in fear, afraid of making mistakes or showing vulnerability, because these things are associated with losing their job or losing influence.

When people do not feel psychological safety at work, they take fewer risks, critical questions are not surfaced, difficult conversations are avoided and innovation is stifled. Too many decisions require intervention from senior leaders. This forces senior leaders to expend a lot of their time on less critical issues that could easily be delegated, rather than focus on higher-impact challenges and opportunities.

Conversely, in organizations that create psychological safety people know that if they make a mistake or have shortcomings, they will be supported and not reprimanded. While writing this article, I faced a severe case of writer’s block. I struggled for a few weeks, and felt too embarrassed to ask for help — after-all I’m supposed to be a leader who knows this stuff. I eventually got over my insecurity and tweeted my challenge; within 24 hours three colleagues at work had spent hours with me on a weekend to help me assemble my thoughts into a first draft. I never felt that any of them would judge me, and that level of psychological safety allowed me to share something I’m struggling with.

### Increase psychological safety on your own team

#### Approach conflict as a collaborator, not an adversary.

We humans hate losing even more than we love winning. A perceived loss triggers attempts to reestablish fairness through competition, criticism, or disengagement, which is a form of workplace-learned helplessness. That true success is a win-win outcome, so when conflicts come up, he avoids triggering a fight-or-flight reaction by asking, “How could we achieve a mutually desirable outcome?”

#### Speak human to human

Underlying every team’s who-did-what confrontation are universal needs such as respect, competence, social status, and autonomy. Recognizing these deeper needs naturally elicits trust and promotes positive language and behaviors. Reminded the team that even in the most contentious negotiations, the other party is just like them and aims to walk away happy. He led them through a reflection called “Just Like Me,” which asks you to consider:

  - This person has beliefs, perspectives, and opinions, just like me.
  - This person has hopes, anxieties, and vulnerabilities, just like me.
  - This person has friends, family, and perhaps children who love them, just like me.
  - This person wants to feel respected, appreciated, and competent, just like me.
  - This person wishes for peace, joy, and happiness, just like me.

#### Anticipate reactions and plan countermoves

“Thinking through in advance how your audience will react to your
messaging helps ensure your content will be heard, versus your audience
hearing an attack on their identity or ego,”

Skillfully confront difficult conversations head-on by preparing for likely reactions. For example, you may need to gather concrete evidence to counter defensiveness when discussing hot-button issues. Leaders should, “If I position my point in this manner, what are the possible objections, and how would I respond to those counterarguments?” He says, “Looking at the discussion from this third-party perspective exposes weaknesses in my positions and encourages me to rethink my argument.”

Specifically, he asks:

  - What are my main points?
  - What are three ways my listeners are likely to respond?
  - How will I respond to each of those scenarios?

#### Replace blame with curiosity. 

If team members sense that you’re trying to blame them for something, you become their saber-toothed tiger. John Gottman’s  [research](https://www.gottman.com/blog/transforming-criticism-into-wishes-a-recipe-for-successful-conflict/) at the University of Washington shows that blame and criticism reliably escalate conflict, leading to defensiveness and — eventually — to disengagement. The alternative to blame is curiosity. If you believe you already know what the other person is thinking, then you’re not ready to have a conversation. Instead, adopt a learning mindset, knowing you don’t have all the facts. Here’s how:

  - State the problematic behavior or outcome as an observation, and use factual, neutral language. For example, “In the past two months there’s been a noticeable drop in your participation during meetings and progress appears to be slowing on your project.”
  - Engage them in an exploration. For example, “I imagine there are multiple factors at play. Perhaps we could uncover what they are together?”
  - Ask for solutions. The people who are responsible for creating a problem often hold the keys to solving it. That’s why a positive outcome typically depends on their input and buy-in. Ask directly, “What do you think needs to happen here?” Or, “What would be your ideal scenario?” Another question leading to solutions is: “How could I support you?”

#### Ask for feedback on delivery. 

Asking for feedback on how you delivered your message disarms your opponent, illuminates blind spots in communication skills, and models fallibility, which increases trust in leaders. Closes difficult conversations with these questions:

  - What worked and what didn’t work in my delivery?
  - How did it feel to hear this message?
  - How could I have presented it more effectively?

For example, Asked about his delivery after giving his senior manager tough feedback. His manager replied, “This could have felt like a punch in the stomach, but you presented reasonable evidence and that made me want to hear more. You were also eager to discuss the challenges I had, which led to solutions.”

#### Measure psychological safety.

Periodically asks his team how safe they feel and what could enhance their feeling of safety. In addition, his team routinely takes  [surveys on psychological safety](http://www.midss.org/content/team-learning-and-psychological-safety-survey) and other team dynamics. Some teams at Google include questions such as, “How confident are you that you won’t receive retaliation or criticism if you admit an error or make a mistake?”

If you create this sense of psychological safety on your own team starting now, you can expect to see higher levels of engagement, increased motivation to tackle difficult problems, more learning and development opportunities, and better performance.

## Culture is Shaped by Hire, Fire, Demote, and Promote

### Factors describe the behaviors of leaders who had those high-performance teams

Promotions are particularly powerful indicators of what your company rewards. When someone gets promoted, other colleagues look to understand how that person achieved the promotion, and draw valuable insights about your company’s reward system and values.

When an individual is performing highly and upholds company values, a promotion reinforces your high-performance culture. Conversely, when an individual is not performing well, or disregards the company’s values, a promotion signals to everyone else that your values and high-performance culture are phoney.

Similarly, when high-performing, values-aligned employees get passed over during promotions, without compelling reasons, it creates ambiguity about what people really need to do to get rewarded. The same principle applies to terminations.

## What You Will Do...

  - Participate in team building activities and learn how teams differ from traditional work groups.
  - Create a team charter that includes a clear statement of your team’s purpose, operating guidelines, performance objectives, and an ideal team vision.
  - Learn good meeting management skills, critique your meeting effectiveness, and develop action plans to improve your meetings.
  - Identify your team’s customer requirements and how these guide team performance.
  - Analyze and streamline the core work of the team.
  - Clarify team member roles and responsibilities and ensure greater accountability.
  - Set up systems for measuring your performance, setting goals, and tracking progress.

High performance team generate commitment. They provide the structure and a common vision that inspire people to give their best effort.

### Personalisation

Just as companies create personalised experiences for customers to boost sales, these same companies could benefit from creating personalised experiences for their employees to boost output.

But what does personalisation mean in the context of the workplace?

**It’s about designing spaces that suit employee personas, providing technology that helps individuals perform, and creating meaningful experiences.    **

With the trend of personalisation set to flow over to the working world, companies should explore the following ways to create more meaningful experiences for their employees.

### Space for everyone

A personalised workspace used to mean having photos of your family and various personal items on your desk. However, these days as open plan offices and activity-based working become the norm, a personalised workspace is more about design that caters to employees' physical and psychological needs.

Everyone has a different way of working. Some people like to work in busy collaborative areas and others prefer individual spaces for deep concentration. A  [2016 study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122415622391) by the American Sociological Review found that when people control when and where they work they become more productive, healthier, and happier.

Companies that understand their employee’s personas and working styles can design office spaces that suit them. This in turn creates a more engaged workforce, which results in higher employee output and retention.

Things to consider:

  - When redesigning your office, start by consulting your employees to find out what they want.  [Sendero Consulting](https://www.bisnow.com/dallas-ft-worth/news/office/want-to-design-the-perfect-office-ask-your-employees-for-advice-87337?utm_source=CopyShare&utm_medium=Browser) did just that to great effect.
  - Map out the different types of personas in your company (i.e. the split of introverts vs extroverts) and design accordingly.

### Automated Experiences

Advances in technology, such as high-speed Wi-Fi networking and sensors, are creating new opportunities to personalise the workplace. Intelligent technology solutions can be adapted for individual situations, saving people time and making them more efficient.

Fully automated meeting spaces are still in their infancy, but sensors are already being used to automatically adjust lighting and temperature as employees enter meeting rooms. It won’t be long before rooms will be able to detect and optimise the sensory experience for employees. A  [project at MIT](http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-media-lab-smart-office-mediated-atmospheres-0713) is already exploring this using bio sensors and machine learning.

[55 million workplace meetings happen every day](https://blog.lucidmeetings.com/blog/fresh-look-number-effectiveness-cost-meetings-in-us) in the US alone, and personalised solutions that can make these experiences more efficient are becoming very popular. At Sony we have developed a room booking solution,  [TEOS Book](http://bit.ly/2zluWmq), which automatically shows your meeting details on an interactive tablet that can be used to extend or find other meeting rooms. Employees can also use a mobile app,  [TEOS Mobile](http://bit.ly/2L04SUB), that gives them full control over their meeting management and a view of personal statistics.

To fully take advantage of smart technology solutions companies should invest in a workplace management system that can aggregate office data, create smart actions, and automate targeted messaging. At Sony we recently worked on a project where the Dutch Charity Lotteries wanted to easily automate and personalise signage for visitors attending events at their offices, for menus at their canteen, and to show live results and dashboards at their call centre. They were able to bring this vision to life with our workplace management solution,  [TEOS Manage](http://bit.ly/2KWQDzW), and  [BRAVIA Professional Displays](https://pro.sony/en_GB/products/professional-displays/ten-reasons-to-love-bravia).

Things to consider:

  - Explore technologies such as sensors and workplace management solutions that can help employees get the most out of the spaces around them.

### Freedom to Choose

Giving employees more flexibility to choose how they work can increase productivity and satisfaction. A  [study by EY](https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Global_generations_study/$FILE/EY-global-generations-a-global-study-on-work-life-challenges-across-generations.pdf) of 10,000 employees found that flexibility is almost as important as a competitive salary.

I covered workspace design earlier, but the same flexible mindset should also be applied to the technology tools employees can use.  [Research has shown](https://go.apperian.com/rs/300-EOJ-215/images/Apperian%202016%20Executive%20Enterprise%20Mobility%20Report_FINAL_20160216.pdf?aliId=16373787) that employees not only work faster when using their personal devices (BYOD), but they feel empowered by the flexibility it gives them.

Giving employees the option to provide feedback on new workplace technology or processes lets them be heard and improves satisfaction. Weight Watchers use touch screens outside meeting rooms that have an emoji scale to collect feedback. When they added whiteboards that displayed meeting agendas in conference rooms, [dissatisfaction decreased from 44 percent to just 16 percent](https://hbr.org/2016/09/use-subtle-cues-to-encourage-better-meetings).

Things to consider:

  - Is a BYOD policy possible at your workplace? If so, remember to first check security and compatibility risks with your IT Manager.
  - Use a survey solution to gauge employee satisfaction after making changes to your workplace.

## Balanced with a Human Touch

### Personalisation

When it comes to personalised experiences, technology definitely has its benefits. However, it also has its limitations. Companies shouldn’t forget the importance of good old-fashioned human interaction.

If a workforce was only communicating digitally employees would feel isolated, and social relationships that are vital for satisfaction would be damaged. There’s a well-known study,  [the Grant Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Study), that followed the lives of 268 Harvard undergraduates over 75 years and it showed the strongest predictor of satisfaction wasn’t their career achievements or earnings, but instead the strength of their relationships.

[A more recent
study](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/no-employee-is-an-island/) by Wharton Business School of 700 employees and managers found that loneliness was directly linked to poor performance. 

Though our workplace is increasingly dominated by technology, leaders and managers must find ways to build personal human relationships with their employees. We all crave this\!

Things to consider:

  - When possible, opt for face-to-face conversations instead of sending emails or messages (and  [don’t leave your phone on the table](https://psmag.com/social-justice/presence-smart-phone-lowers-quality-person-conversations-85805) when you do meet in person\!).
  - Invest in getting to know your colleagues on a personal level. Taking time to talk and listen will help them feel more fulfilled at work.

**Companies need to let go of the one-size-fits-all strategy and cater to each of their employees individually. A truly personalised workplace is one that is thoughtfully designed and equipped with smart technology. It’s a workplace where managers listen to their employees and help them understand the purpose of their role so that they feel a connection to their organisation and spaces around them.**
